-Disable observers post test run
-Allow db:seed_fu RAILS_ENV=test to be run more than once without error
-fix diffs_in_between, was passing in the default_options for grit, but grit in this case doesn't take options, fixed the test to actually fail if the incorrect diffs are returned
-make notes/commits render against proper project
-MR discussion file links should reference note's project
-Added tests for commit links on edit merge request
-fixes edit issues (canceling an edited mr, updating an edited mr)
-updates tests with checks for source code updates
-still forked_merge_requests.feature (project_forked_merge_requests) test not passing (commented out -- ""stable"" not being set)

MR API: error on bad target_project

-If the target project id is specified and it is not the same as the project the request is being made on (the source), and the it isn't a fork of that project, error out, otherwise use it as the target
-Fixes some busted (but hidden) test cases

This has a very different interface to the Downloader class, because
a handful of operations need to be run off the main thread (not just
download, but also totalDownloadSize and perhaps cache tag related
stuff). The AsyncDownloadWrapper provides its own listener, more
specific than just the progress listener, which invokes functions
at different points in time (e.g. download failed, completed, cancelled).

Refactored progress events to use string types instead of ints.
This way, it is less likely that two different events from
different processes will clash with each other.

This was a bit more complex than all the other views, because it supports
rotation, and different views for when it is rotated. The end result is
that the way in which the views were constructed needed to be completely
redone.

In the process, I also moved the layout of the app summary to a Relative
Layout. This adds more flexibility, and is also the suggested layout
for complex views (as apposed to nested linear layouts). I believe this
is due to the performance of relative vs linear layotus.

It was aprticularly hard to figure out what was going on
when rotating an Activity which had a list fragment
that had another fragment as a header. I don't think fragments
were designed to work like this, but I believe it is all working
as expected now.

I had a couple of months of changes which I rebased over master.
It made me sad. After doign what I thought was required to resolve
conflicts, I've now gone and fixed a few bits here and there.

This arose because I didn't try and compile after each merge conflict.
I'll take the lesson onboard and try to remember to do this in the

@sytse How would you like to address this in [the article](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/02/10/gitlab-reduced-merge-conflicts-by-90-percent-with-changelog-placeholders/)? Simply replace ""Thanks ayufan, we'll try this instead."" by ""Thanks ayufan, we've implemented this instead.""?

Integration branch containing both MR 102 and 107

Given both MR !102 and !107 both stood on eachothers feet to some extent, this branch contains all commits from both in an integration branch. If both @Nutomic and @eighthave are happy that it faithfully kept their changes during the minor merge conflict resolutions, then we can merge this instead of those two branches. 

* !102 changed download progress from events + listeners to broadcasts + receivers.
* !107 made use of download progress events + listeners to show a downloading UI that was embedded in the activity, rather than shown as a modal dialog.

The conflicts which arose while I merged these branches together were in `AppDetails`. I made it so that, to the best of my ability, it uses broadcast receivers instead of progress listeners when updating the progress bar. Other than that, the only other conflict was both trying to store a reference to the main button from the UI. The only changes were in naming (mainButton vs btMain) and also in the place where the local variable was assigned (onCreate() vs setupViews() which is called during onCreate() anyway).

After merging, I did some minor cleanups. This is because in the process of checking that my conflict resolution compiled, I thought it best to remove a bunch of warnings from `AppDetails` and others. Turns out that by doing so, I found a bug due to the integration (to do with the `AppDetails` querying the downloader for status in `onResume()` rather than waiting for a broadcast event) so I'm glad I did so.

Let me know what you think, and then after the next stable, we can go ahead and merge this if people are happy.

p.s. I have no idea why GitLab is showing @eighthave's commit at the top of the list of commits, after my integration related commits.

Get ""Merge when build succeeds"" to work when commits were pushed to MR
target branch while builds were running

The Merge when build succeeds service only merges when the MR is
mergeable (open, not WIP, no conflicts).

When the target branch is updated, all affected MRs have their merge
status set to `unchecked`, and the conflicts check will only happen
when `check_if_can_be_merged` is called, which happens when the MR page
is viewed.

When someone enables the automatic merge, the target branch is updated,
no-one views the MR page again, and the build succeeds, the mergeability
check will fail and the MR will not in fact be merged.

This MR makes sure `check_if_can_be_merged` is always called when MR
mergeability is checked.

Reduce code complexity on GitPushService#execute

Code complexity for gitlab-ce after this has been refactored:

```
This still needs to be merged into `gitlab-ee` presumably with conflicts... Perhaps we should create another issue for doing that?

I left the code sort of similar to what it was... If I could, I would have refactored most of the code into separate classes, etc. as it breaks probably all SOLID principles.

Ensure only IDs ending in .git perform git actions

## What does this MR do?

Rails's routing is pretty strange. Previously, `GET /namespace/project/info/refs` would go to the Git HTTP controller (if the redirect for that case was taken out).

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The specs fail if the redirect is moved to above the Git HTTP routes, removed altogether, or the Git HTTP constraints are changed. But there might still be missing cases.

## Why was this MR needed?

The master build and HTTP cloning were both broken.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes #18376.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

Nope.

Enable RuboCop for migrations

## What does this MR do?

Enable RuboCop for all files inside `db/migrate`, then add magic comments to all existing files, so that this only affects new migrations.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

This entire change is a config change and a bunch of comments.

hmm, it's already enabled

Douwe Maan [11:57 AM]  
@smcgivern: heh

Sean McGivern [11:59 AM]  
I guess that's because we don't want to change the old migrations? I wonder if it's worth enabling it and adding magic comments to all the previous ones to ignore rubocop

None.

None, but if I remove the magic comment from the migration `20160416182152_convert_award_note_to_emoji_award.rb` I get:

Don't require Gitlab::Redis in mail_room.yml if it's already defined

Avoid requiring `lib/gitlab/redis.rb` if `Gitlab::Redis` is already defined.

No.

Because otherwise you get `already initialized constant Gitlab::Redis::XXX`, e.g.:

Fix migration helper race conditions

## What does this MR do?

This MR fixes two problems with the migration helpers:

1. An error in `change_column_null` would not drop the previously created column
2. `update_column_in_batches` would rely on the number of rows in a table to determine how many to update. This meant that newly inserted rows (after the `COUNT`) would not be taken into account.

Update allocations Gem & ignore classes without names

## What does this MR do?

1. Updates the allocations Gem to 1.0.5 so it can be used on 2.2/2.3 without crashing
2. Changes the background sampler to ignore classes/modules without a name (as we can't do much with these)

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

No.

## Why was this MR needed?

Using MRI 2.2 or 2.3 would lead to a segmentation fault in the allocations Gem, sometimes this problem would also occur on 2.1

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Not an issue, but the merge request that highlighted these problems: !3807

Fixes bulk-assign labels not working when navigating through pages

## What does this MR do?
This MR fixes an issue on bulk-assign labels not working when navigating though pages. The functionality was not working because events on checkboxes weren't working. This re-runs `Issuable.initChecks()` and makes sure we are not leaving zombie event handlers by turning them off first.

Also fixes tests to use `wait_for_ajax` since label filtering is now using `Turbolinks` for redirection.

Resolve ""Track the number of new Redis connections per transaction""

## What does this MR do?

Add a new metric counter, `new_redis_connections`, that contains the number of calls to `Redis::Client#connect` in the current transaction.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Not sure. I tested this in kind of a brute-force way:

1. Add a debugger in the monkey-patched `connect` method.
2. With metrics enabled, start the app and load a page.
3. The first Redis connection is created by `Rack::Attack` and isn't in a transaction, but still works fine.
4. The second Redis connection is within a transaction (the page load), and increments the counter.
5. If I reload the page, neither debugger is hit.
6. If I use a Redis client and do `CLIENT KILL` on my two existing clients, then reload the page, I get 3 and 4 again.
7. If I disable metrics collection, the debugger never gets hit.

## Why was this MR needed?

We may have a Redis connection leak somewhere, so adding metrics will let us track this.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes #18451.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

Hahaha nope, not relevant.

Eager load project relations in IssueParser

## What does this MR do?

This changes the ReferenceParser class to eager load various associations. This in turn results in the permissions checking code (e.g. the `Ability` model) to _not_ run dozens if not hundreds of extra SQL queries depending on the amount of references involved (in a single document).

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

No.

## Why was this MR needed?

In !4410 it was revealed a _lot_ of a queries came from the `Ability` model and the code it would call. In many cases this was because the code would simply get a project, then get the owners; or get a group, then get some association of that. Eager loading these associations is a fairly simple solution and greatly cuts down the number of queries.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

None.

Turn Group#owners into a has_many association

## What does this MR do?

This turns the regular method `Group#owners` into a `has_many` association.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

As far as I can tell there's no way to do this without using an intermediate association, but perhaps I'm missing something. The reason an intermediate association is needed is because the supplied Proc is applied to the _final_ association (the one returning users), this means that when using a single `has_many` you can't filter out any intermediate rows (e.g. group members).

## Why was this MR needed?

This code being a regular method would prevent eager loading of the owners of a Group, turning it into a `has_many` association resolves this problem. This was discovered in !4410.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

None.

Fix permission checks in member row (backport from gitlab-org/gitlab-ee!460)

It improves the check we use to display or not the members' access and controls in the members list.

No, I replaced an helper with just a permission check so I think it's a better solution.

Validate only and except regexp

## What does this MR do?
Adds a better validation for only and except which can contain regexps.

## Why was this MR needed?
Currently the RegexpError can be raised when processing next stage which leads to 500 in different places of code base.
This adds early check that regexps used in only and except are valid.

Disable the email checking part of the standard Health Check

## What does this MR do?
    
In order to fix it we have overwritten the email_configured? method in the health check so that it does not check email status during the standard health check.

## Why was this MR needed?

The email check used in the Heath Check doesn't properly make use of enough of the SMTP config options to be able to properly test the STMP connection, and as a result could cause a failure.

Re-implement page-specific JS in a better way.

## What does this MR do?

This rebuilds the way we do page-specific JavaScript assets for a few reasons:

- The current implementation does not work with Subresource Integrity (!4808)
- The current implementation doesn't allow caching of libraries because each page we hook up with this system will have a separate application.js. Meaning that for every page that uses Ace Editor, we'd have to load Ace Editor plus any GitLab-specific scripts in the same file, making local caching of just Ace Editor impossible.
- The current implementation is rather hacky.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

That Sprockets doesn't choke on this when we use precompiled assets.

Clean up some unused templates imported from GitLab CI, for new developers to easily understand the file/directory structure of Gitlab CE.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Be sure if removed files are not used now while the committer checked them once.

Image sizing

## What does this MR do?

Limits image height to fit the screen. The wrapping div is so the image is guaranteed to be a block element without the link area growing to be larger than the image itself.

Add custom highlighting via .gitattributes

## What does this MR do?
Allows user control of language selection via a `gitlab-language` entry in `.gitattributes`

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
(paired with @stanhu)

## Why was this MR needed?
Guessing languages by filename is fraught and often wrong. In one project, `foo.pl` may be perl, and in another it may be prolog. Users might have a Thingfile that needs ruby highlighting, or depend on things that can't work in general, like `*.C` (capitalized) mapping to C++ instead of C.

This allows the user to override language choice so they never have to look at a mis-highlighted file.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?
https://github.com/jneen/rouge/issues/494
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13818 (*.tpl can't in general map to Smarty)
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13615 (in cases we don't have a language and mis-identify it, users could map to 'text' to turn off highlighting)

Bugzilla Integration

## What does this MR do?
Adds Bugzilla as a project service for external issue tracking

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?
Provides a notable Bugzilla option for use as an external issue tracker.  Existing Custom Issue tracker can be used to setup Bugzilla but this makes it clear that Bugzilla is an option.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?
Closes #14669

Disabled native autocomplete for dropdown filter inputs

## What does this MR do?

Disables native autocomplete for the dropdown filter inputs.

Fixed 'use shortcuts' button on docs

Is this the best implementation? I actually think this is tidier than doing something like `onclick=""new Shortcuts().onToggleHelp""` or `$.trigger 'keydown', char: '?'` but let me know.

Make Rack::Request use our trusted proxies when filtering IP addresses

## What does this MR do?

This allows us to control the trusted proxies while deployed in a private network.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

If we want to limit what is impacted, we can do this specifically for the rack_attack request object.

## Why was this MR needed?

Normally Rack::Request will trust all private IPs as trusted proxies, which can cause problems if your users are connection on you network via private IP ranges.
    
Normally in a rails app this is handled by action_dispatch request, but rack_attack is specifically using the Rack::Request object instead.

Fix emoji paths in relative root configurations

## What does this MR do?

If a site specifies a relative URL root, emoji files would omit the path from the URL, leading to lots of 404s.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

At first, I tried to use `ActionView::Helpers::AssetUrlHelper.asset_url` since this is what it's intended to do. But this helper function is extremely slow, and it took minutes to generate the URLs for the hundreds of links needed for each emoji.

## Why was this MR needed?

Because emojis were broken in relative URL installations

Exclude requesters from Project#members, Group#members and User#members

## What does this MR do?

It excludes requesters from the `Project#members`, `Group#members` and `User#members` associations, and adds new `Project#requesters` and `Group#requesters` associations.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

No.

## Why was this MR needed?

Without this, if you call `project.members`, requesters are included in the results! This is at best misleading, and at worst can lead to security issues. By excluding requesters from the `#members` associations, we avoid introducing security inadvertently since you have to call the `#requesters` association explicitly to get requesters.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

This is something I realized while fixing the security issue #19102.

Hacked in a better message for attachment network error

## What does this MR do?

Adds a better error message for when a user is uploading an attachment and they cannot reach the GitLab instance.

Now displays `Network error. Please check your connection.`.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

As noted above, I think this is hacky, ideally this would be sent straight from the backend but if not then this should be handled globally?

Allow specifying protected branches using wildcards

Closes #18627 

# Tasks

- [ ]  #18627 !4665 Allow specifying protected branches using wildcards
    - [x]  Find existing usages of protected branches
        - Protecting branches
            - `ProtectedBranchesController` is used to mark a branch protected/unprotected
            - `API::Branches` can be used to mark a branch protected/unprotected
        - Enforcing branch protection
            - `Gitlab::GitAccess` has helpers (`can_push_to_branch?`, `check`) that are used to deny pushes if a branch is protected
            - Over SSH: `gitlab-shell` receives a push, and calls `/allowed` on the GitLab API, which calls `GitAccess.check`
            - Over HTTP: 
                - `gitlab-workhorse` receives the request, and forwards it to rails
                - Rails (in the `GitHttpController#git-recieve-pack`) runs basic checks (is the user logged in, not protected branch checks) and returns ok with `GL_ID` and `RepoPath`
                - `gitlab-workhorse` looks at the response, and calls the relevant `gitlab-shell` action from `git-http/handlePostRPC`
                - Rest of this flow is the same as the SSH flow above
    - [x]  Implementation
        - [x]  Backend
            - [x]  Change `project#protected_branch?` to look at wildcard protected branches
            - [x]  Change `project#developers_can_push_to_protected_branch?`
            - [x]  Change `project#open_branches`
            - [x]  Better error message when creating a disallowed branch from the Web UI
        - [x]  Frontend
            - [x]  Protected branches page should allow typing out a wildcard pattern
            - [x]  Add help text explaining the use of wildcards
            - [x]  Show matching branches for each protected branch
                - [x]  ~~On the index page~~
                - [x]  On a show page
                - [x]  Index?
            - [x]  Can't have the ""last commit"" column for wildcard protected branches
    - [x]  Fix / write tests
    - [x]  What happens if a hook is missing in dev?
    - [x]  Refactor

Avoid calculation of closes_issues.

## What does this MR do?

Avoid unneeded calls to MR closes issues

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I'm not sure if calling this method from a view is a good practice, but I cannot see another simple way of avoiding this problem. In case we want to avoid this in the controller we need to specify the action, format and status of the merge request, because in that case we know that the `_open` partial will render. We could add some lazy evaluation but it not a thing I see in use along the app but feedback is welcome

Update New Snippet buttons.

## What does this MR do?

No longer shows New Snippet button to users who aren't able to create a new snippet in the given context.

Also removes the plus icon from the New Snippet buttons, as they're no longer used in other creation buttons.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Make sure the snippets pages don't break or show the buttons to users who shouldn't have access to them.

## Why was this MR needed?

Users that weren't logged in would click the New Snippet button and get a 404 error. You would also get 404 errors from the New Snippet button on project snippets for projects you weren't able to create snippets for.

Clean up coffeescript files imported from GitLab CI

## What does this MR do?

This MR cleans up CoffeeScript files imported from GitLab CI along with a strategy #19159. Some files should have been removed in !1987.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

While I think the `Build` module should be named as `Build`, not `CiBuild` in the JavaScript namespace, please check if it should.

## Why was this MR needed?

Removing unused coffeescript files reduces time to build JS and so time to transfer even in production. The fewer files, the better, too.

Optimize cross ref system notes check

## What does this MR do?

This MR optimizes system note visibility checking by memoizing the visible reference count, reducing the overhead of calling `Note#cross_reference_not_visible_for?`.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Note that since a cross reference message contains, ""Mentioned in XYZ"", we EXPECT that there is at least one reference. That's why using the ref count > 0 works. 

## Why was this MR needed?

The previous implementation relied on `Note#cross_reference_not_visible_for?`, which essentially tries to render all the Markdown references in a system note
and only displays the note if the user can see the referring project. But this duplicated the work that Banzai::NotesRenderer was doing already. This shaves about 0.8 s
from the load time from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/operations/issues/42.

No.

Fix the problem where a user's award emoji aren't deleted when the user is deleted.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The corresponding SELECT for the migration runs in 0.3s on staging, but I can't test the delete there or on production easily. It should be reasonably quick.

Allow developers to merge into a protected branch without having push access

## What does this MR do?

Adds a ""Developers can merge"" checkbox to protected branches much like the ""Developers can push"" checkbox. When the checkbox is enabled, a developer can merge MRs into that protected branch from the Web UI and from the command-line (any push that is entirely composed of merge commits is allowed).

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

- This MR refactors the `GitAccess` module, moving parts of it to `UserAccess` and the new `ChangeAccessCheck`.
- This MR refactors `GitAccessSpec`, which generates a ""matrix"" of tests.
- The main logic ""developers can merge"" should be straightforward enough.
- The commits are fairly atomic, and the commit messages are descriptive regarding the motivations behind every change.

## Why was this MR needed?

A significant portion of this feature was implemented in !4220 (thanks, @mvestergaard!) ; I'm wrapping it up.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

#18193 
Closes #967

## TODO

- [ ]  #18193 !4892 Add ""developers can merge"" as an option for protected branches
    - [x]  Review existing code
    - [x]  Fix build
    - [x]  Implementation / refactoring
        - [x]  Clean up `GitAccess`
        - [x]  Clean up `protected_branches.js.coffee`
        - [x]  Figure out authorization issue
            - If we try to merge code into a protected branch for a user who doesn't have access to that branch, an auth check will fail
            - We need to get around this, somehow
            - [x]  Try detecting merge commits and allowing those
        - [x]  A push with regular commits _and_ merge commits should fail
            - [x]  Figure out a solution
            - [x]  Extensive tests for `MergeCommitCheck`
    - [x]  Add tests
        - [x]  Untested parts of original MR
    - [x]  Improve the checks in `/allowed`
        -  @dzaporozhets's proposal:
            - commits in push == commits in merge request
            - branch to push == target branch of merge request
            - merge request has required amount of approves (ee only)
            - merge commit in push == merge commit we created when merged via UI
            - save merge commit sha in database and compare with `newrev`
        - my proposal
            - /allowed finds all open merge requests with the appropriate target branch
            - For each MR, compare the commit SHAs in the MR to the commit SHAs in the change set
            - If we have a match, compare the diff of the matching MR to the diff of the change set
            - If we still have a match, the merge is legit
        - [x]  Wait for replies on my proposal
        - [x]  Pick a strategy
        - [x]  Implementation
            - [x]  Save `in_progress_merge_commit_sha`
            - [x]  Check `in_progress_merge_commit_sha`
            - [x]  Clear `in_progress_merge_commit_sha`
        - [x]  Test / refactor
    - [x]  Merge conflicts
    - [x]  Verify workflows
        - [x]  Developer with 'developer can merge' on:
            - [x]  Can merge an MR from the Web UI
            - [x]  Error message for conflicts in the Web UI
            - [x]  Cannot merge an MR from the command line (HTTP)
            - [x]  Cannot merge an MR from the command line (SSH)
            - [x]  Cannot modify the branch otherwise

            - [x]  Cannot modify the branch otherwise
        - [x]  New projects created could have have ""Developers can merge"" turned on automatically for the default branch
    - [x]  CHANGELOG
    - [x]  Fix build
    - [x]  Wait for [build](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/42624e3d53754064186d4ae9048e310d1d3eed0b/builds) to pass

    - [x]  Assign to endboss
    - [x]  Respond to @dbalexandre's comments
        - [x]  Duplicated line, this is equals to line 26.
        - [x]  We aren't using any of these helpers in this migration, we can remove the include.
        - [x]  What do you think to add a default value for this column to avoid the Three-state Boolean Problem?
        - [x]  group all checks under Gitlab::Checks
        - [x]  You have a default value for developers_can_merge column, but your migration doesn't add it.
        - [x]  What do you think to rename Partially protected to anything else?
    - [x]  Fix conflicts
    - [x]  Make sure [build](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/b1cfd42f20a78fd7f844288954e97cff32962e20/builds) passes

Allow to access Container Registry for Public and Internal projects

## What does this MR do?
Adds missing ability `read_container_image` for `public scope` which affects users accessing public and internal projects.

## Why was this MR needed?
Previously, we allowed to use container registry for anonymous users, but did not allow to do the same for logged in.
This MR makes it possible.

Fix activity heatmap to show proper day name.

## What does this MR do?
This MR fixes issue #19909.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Not necessarily, it's pretty straightforward, buuuut

There was some discussion about whether GL wanted the activity heatmap to start on Monday or Sunday, this fix makes it start on Sunday, if GL is wanting it to start on Monday then some more substantial changes need to be made on the `calendar.js.coffee` script.

## Why was this MR needed?
The amount of day names that were off from their dates was too damn high! :P 

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Reduce the number of lines that we highlight on big diffs to try to reduce the degradation introduced by  !4990 as you can see on the issue description #19820 .

We collapse any files after the diff is over the number of safe files (100), or over the safe lines (500) or over the safe number of bytes (5KB x 100 files).

API: Expose 'developers_can_push' for branches

## What does this MR do?

Adds support for the `developers_can_push` flag for the branches API. It also supports creating protected branches with that flag.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The API call requires an optional boolean parameter `developers_can_push`. If it is not either `true` or `false`, it should not update the value. I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it.

Right now it always returns `200`. Maybe the `PUT` method should return different status codes depending if it really created or updated a branch.

## What does this MR do?
It adds `--max-count=1` to the git command used to check for forced push, this way we can have a brief yet indicative output, saving some time used to split the string returned.

Credits go to @pacoguzman for pointing me to the command option.

Fix two small problems on how we handle manual actions

## What does this MR do?
Fixes two small problems in how we handle manual actions:
- On environments page we show a `Play` for the same action that is lately deployed, we should show other actions only
- When we process a pipeline that have only a manual action in a stage, the pipeline will stop being processed.

API for downloading latest successful build

## What does this MR do?

Implement parts of #4255, particularly the API.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I still made it that `ref` could be either branch, tag, or even SHA with:

``` ruby
# ref can't be HEAD, can only be branch/tag name or SHA
scope :latest_successful_for, ->(ref) do
  table = quoted_table_name
  # TODO: Use `where(ref: ref).or(sha: ref)` in Rails 5
  where(""#{table}.ref = ? OR #{table}.sha = ?"", ref, ref).
    success.order(id: :desc)
end
```

Because the reasons I put in:

* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5142#note_13165543
* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5142#note_13165921

But if you still think that it's not good to do it this way, I'll drop it and let's think about the other way to satisfy the requirement specified in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4255#note_13101233 It could be `status=any` or `sha=DEADBEAF`

Fix backup restore

## What does this MR do?

This MR fixes the backup restore task.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Whether the mode 0277 makes sense. (Group SUID + group/user read/write permissions)

## Why was this MR needed?

Just need to make sure there aren't any side effects (`.ci-status-link` being used without an icon).

Rescue Rugged::OSError (lock exists) when creating references.

## What does this MR do?

Rescue an exception on concurrent scenarios. I was able to create a spec for this, because if you create the lock file before trying to create the reference the reference is created without a problem and the lock file is removed. So IMHO there is a race condition where more than one process is trying to create the same reference at the same time raising the exception, so I just added the patch without specs.

```ruby
    it ""attempting to call keep_around when exists a lock does not fail"" do
      ref = repository.send(:keep_around_ref_name, sample_commit.id)
      path = File.join(repository.path, ref)
      lock_path = ""#{path}.lock""

      FileUtils.mkdir_p(path)
      File.open(lock_path, 'w') { |f| f.write('') }

      begin
        # No exception is raised because the lock file is removed at some point in the process
        repository.keep_around(sample_commit.id)
      ensure
        File.delete(path)
        File.delete(lock_path)

It reduces the number of DB queries made while processing and rendering MR notes.

For `https://staging.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/3142/diffs.json`, for each note we make number of DB queries, almost all of them are handled by the AR caching layer, but they seem to add up a few seconds.

Ignore invalid IPs in X-Forwarded-For when trusted proxies are configured.

Catches IPAddr::InvalidAddressError exceptions in `trusted_proxy?` when a) a trusted proxy is set up in the gitlab config and b) an invalid IP address is passed to the method (e.g. one with a port attached). When caught, returns `false` from the method. Prevents a 500 error in this situation.

Fix attr reader to force the intended values for source and target shas

## What does this MR do?

When importing a pull request from GitHub, the old and new branches may no longer actually exist by those names, but we need to recreate the merge
request diff with the right source and target shas.  We use these `target_branch_sha` and `source_branch_sha` attributes to force  these to the intended values. But the reader methods were always looking up to the target/source branch head instead of check if these values was  previously set, this MR applies a memoization pattern to both of them.

Use fewer queries for CI charts

## What does this MR do?
It reduces number of queries sent for aggregating counts for CI graphs.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
N/A

## Why was this MR needed?
For this project (gitlab-ce), loading `/graphs/master/ci` is so slow it times out eventually. I did a quick benchmarking on production and found that it can take 72.5 seconds to only load the controller action variables (there are queries done from the view, didn't look into those). This MR reduces the time to about 2.5 seconds.

Extra improvement could be done by introducing an index on `gl_project_id` and `created_at` for `ci_builds` table, but I can't confirm that right  now.

webhooks: include old revision in MR update events

## What does this MR do?

Includes the old revision for an MR in webhooks.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The docs do not give an example `update` hook; should I add one?

## Why was this MR needed?

In order to keep web hook listeners stateless, it helps to include the previous revision of the MR in the hook so that it does not need to remember the last revision (which may also be wrong in case of missed or out-of-order events due to previous errors).

Fix filter input alignment

## What does this MR do?
If you carefully observe the filter inputs on the [issues page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues) and the [projects dashboard page](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/projects), you will notice that those input fields are actually a few pixels lower than the UI elements beside them (More so for the projects dashboard page than the issues page).

Cache diff syntax highlighted output

## What does this MR do?

Cache highlighted diffs for merge requests when they are requested for existing merge requests but after each change on the merge request diff recalculate again the cache.

I've introduced the concept of SafeDiffs which are the diffs that we're going to show on the UI and will be highlighted so maybe we can extend cache capabilities to more diffs.

The more problematic part is what and how we cache the highlighted lines, for the moment what I did was store in Redis as Gitlab::Diff::Line serialized as an array of json objects, similar of what we do for commits and diffs on merge request diffs.

The next step can be add a new field in the merge_request_diff object if we find it worth it. But let's first confirm this is the way to go

Add a data migration to fix some missing timestamps in the members table (again)

## What does this MR do?

Repeats an earlier migration to fix historic bad data in the members table (missing created_at and updated_at fields)

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I'm expecting the WHERE clauses to be fast enough, and to return few enough rows, that the migration doesn't need to use batches, but I'm not too familiar with the size of these tables in the wild, so perhaps that's a poor assumption. 

## Why was this MR needed?

8.10 introduced a dependency on the  `members.created_at` field in the project and namespace member view. If bad data is present, viewing the list of members now results in an NoMethodError and a 500 response from GitLab. Although the previous migration should have fixed all bad rows, we have evidence that it didn't in at least one case, despite the migration claiming to have run in the past.

Move abilities by subject class to a dedicated method

Twin of gitlab-org/gitlab-ee!622.

It moves the `case` that returns abilities depending on the subject class to a dedicated method.

This should avoid lame conflicts when CE to EE since the EE version assign the result of the `case` to a variable.

Makes it possible to use template for badge instead of having multiple files.

Adding a branch with a name like ""foo%20bar"" (via command-line) and setting it to the project's default branch causes the project ""show"" page to 404 for that project. ""assign_ref_vars"" unescapes the branch name (""foo%20bar"" ==> ""foo bar""), making GitLab look for a non-existent branch.
This MR adds logic to skip the URL unescaping step in ""assign_ref_vars"".

Refactor pipeline creation service

## What does this MR do?
This refactors GitLab CI build processing: all builds for pipeline are pre-created when a pipeline object is created. 
The builds are created with a new introduced status `created`.
The builds are then automatically promoted to `pending` when a previous stage do succeed.
This significantly simplifies pipeline processing code solving a lot of problems of lazily initialisation of previous approach (builds were created on-demand).

## Why was this MR needed?
The previous mechanism had a lot of flows (shown in related issues) in how it work, but also in code design. Removing cross model-service-library dependencies.

The current approach moves a build creation to single place `CreatePipelineService` and removes a dynamic dependency on `config_processor` significantly simplifying a build creation and pipeline processing. Pipeline processing is implemented in `ProcessPipelineService`.

This also allows to easily extend GitLab with Manual Actions which is part of 8.10 direction issue.

## Migration problem
~~This MR removes the a on-demand creation of builds in pipelines.
 Pipelines that are running and are in mid-stage (some stages started, but not all) will not be fully evaluated after application restart. 
This happens, because the code responsible for on-demand creation is removed. 
There's no easy way to migrate existing pipelines, other than doing offline migration and putting pipeline processing in migration code (which seems to be a really bad idea).~~

To support old pipelines I added a lazy initialization of builds if none is found.

Improve pipeline processing

## What does this MR do?
This works on top of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5295 trying to solve some edge cases introduced by that Merge Request. The fix switches to a state machine which is already a part of `Ci::Pipeline` and uses events with conditional transitions to switch between pipeline states.

This is approach is much more bullet proof and much easier to understand than a previous one where we were calling a `reload_status!` which manually updated `status`. Previous approach become confusing and prone to number of errors.

## Why was this MR needed?
This improves changes introduced by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5295

This MR prevents rendering of SVG blobs larger than 2 MB.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I couldn't figure out how to properly test the view for this as this requires a large SVG (inflating the repository size) _or_ stubbing, the latter doesn't really seem possible using Spinach and all the stuff potentially involved.

This MR adds a test coverage badge.

Test coverage badge will be a SVG image you can embed in README.md or on your website that will be created dynamically by GitLab, to show information about how much of the code is being covered by tests. In addition to coverage-regexp feature we currently have, this feature will make it possible to use the coverage data obtained from the build log. We will support both - pipeline coverage, or test coverage for particular job in the pipeline.

!581 has a lot of changes that would cause merge conflicts if not
properly backported to CE. This commit/MR serves as a better
foundation for gitlab-org/gitlab-ee!581.

= Changes =

1. Move from `has_one {merge,push}_access_level` to `has_many`, with the
   `length` of the association limited to `1`. This is _effectively_ a
   `has_one` association, but should cause less conflicts with EE, which
   is set to `has_many`. This has a number of related changes in the
   views, specs, and factories.

2. Make `gon` variable loading more consistent (with EE!581) in the
   `ProtectedBranchesController`. Also use `::` to prefix the
   `ProtectedBranches` services, because this is required in EE.

3. Extract a `ProtectedBranchAccess` concern from the two access level
   models. This concern only has a single `humanize` method here, but
   will have more methods in EE.

4. Add `form_errors` to the protected branches creation form. This is
   not strictly required for EE compatibility, but was an oversight
   nonetheless.

Truncated long user lists in award emoji tooltips

## What does this MR do?
Truncates award emoji tooltips so that they only show 10 users maximum.

Further users are indicated by appending ""and X more.""

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Is 10 too little, should it be raised?

My test cases rely on join() to build the expected output.
This feels a little iffy is it alright?

## Why was this MR needed?
Some issues have a large number of thumbs causing tooltips to be very large.

Fix Ace syntax highlighting with compiled assets

## What does this MR do?

Update ACE to 4.1.0 to allow modes (syntax highlighting files for particular languages) to be lazily loaded.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Don't think so.

## Why was this MR needed?

Syntax highlighting in the file editor only worked in development and test modes, not in production!

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes #3225.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

First, the test setup - add these lines to `development.rb`:
```ruby
  config.assets.debug = false
  config.assets.compile = false
  config.assets.digest = true
```

Then, before starting the server, run `bundle exec rake assets:clobber assets:precompile`.

Before:

![image](/uploads/486198e273019f8969d2e90560d82928/image.png)

There is an error in the console because `/assets/ace/mode-ruby.js` was not found (it's only available when assets are compiled on demand).

After:

![image](/uploads/6aa0d69b7efdfd6fe6aa22b9a49e9716/image.png)

This loads `/assets/ace/mode-ruby-3915f95a6cc47306b1305e4dcb7aca25b2ef9c49b18ec6011707135b6575d8f3.js`, which works because the precompile step included it and told ACE where to find it.

Load branch dropdowns asynchronously for cherry pick and revert dialogs

## Why was this MR needed and what does it do?

Previously every commit page was loading every branch onto the page twice, once each for the Cherry Pick and Revert modal dialogs. Most of the time they're never used, so that's a bit of a waste.

This loads them asynchronously by modifying the existing ref switcher code to also work for the branch selectors. This is better for performance.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Make sure Cherry Picking and Reverting still work (from my tests they seem to be fine).

On the Move dropdown on the edit issue page we introduced infinite scrolling to just return a limited number of projects, 50 items. So if the user can move the issue to 50 or more items when scroll down on the list a new set of projects will be requested to the server.

Render coverage badge using latest successful pipeline

## What does this MR do?

This MR make test coverage badge to report value for the latest successful pipeline, instead of the latest one, regardless the status.

Latest pipeline is often running, which makes coverage report inaccurate. Latest pipeline can be also the failed one, which may mean that not all stages got processed, therefore coverage report can be inaccurate as well.

This also improves coverage badge performance because it is not necessary to touch repository to get recent SHA on the branch.

Fix line commenting for the initial commit

## What does this MR do?

Support line positions on the initial commit, where we can't compare because there's no parent commit.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I chose to use the blank SHA to represent the initial commit, but it could as easily be the same SHA. I just thought this was clearer.

Ace ventura

## What does this MR do?

Makes Ace only load when it's actually necessary. The only two places it seems to be used is for Snippets and the File (Blob) Editor.

Before minification or compression, this takes the application.js down from 2.2MB to 1.6MB, and also removes two inline scripts :D

Compressed/Minified: master: 317KB/1.1MB, ace-ventura: 220KB/771KB

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

That this doesn't just completely break anything.

## Why was this MR needed?

Ace is a big library, this allows us to only load it when necessary.

Fix the comparison order in the emails on push worker, so regular pushes don't show a message about force pushing.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Don't think so, it was just a typo: `after_sha` should map to the `source_branch` argument, because it's the head of the comparison.

Update merge_requests.md with a simpler way to check out a merge request

## What does this MR do?

This MR updates `merge_requests.md` with a simpler way to check out a merge request 

The previous way was put under the ""By modifying `.git/config` for a given repository"" section. The disadvantage of the old way is that one has to modify `.git/config` for each repository that one uses. The new way was put under the ""By adding a git alias"" section. One has to create this git alias once, and then it will work from any repository, without having to modify `.git/config` over and over again.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

One should double check that the link provided by the ""Check out branch"" button in a MR, i.e. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/workflow/merge_requests.md#checkout-merge-requests-locally, still works. I think it will, since I didn't modify the ""Checkout merge requests locally"" section name.

## Why was this MR needed?

This MR was needed because the old way of checking out a merge request locally requires to modify `.git/config` in all repositories that one has on a computer, which is a tedious task. The new way just requires adding a simple git alias, once. And the `git mr` command then works for all repositories.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

I haven't created an issue for this.

api: expose web_url for project entities

## What does this MR do?

Adds a `web_url` field to project snippet, issues, and merge request API returned objects.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Tests. Are they sufficient? (I'm working on getting them to pass.)

## Why was this MR needed?

Creating the URL for an MR or issue from the MR is tedious in API libraries; it's easy for Gitlab to just provide it.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

expose 'only_allow_merge_if_build_succeeds' project setting in the API

## What does this MR do?
Adds the 'only_allow_merge_if_build_succeeds' project setting in the API.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
No, but maybe this code is not enough for ACLs or the like.

## Why was this MR needed?
Because that's a very useful setting to change via automation (through the API)

Automatically expand hidden discussions when accessed via a permalink hash (closes #19304)

## What does this MR do?

Addresses ""Auto-expand a discussion note when we arrive via anchor"" (issue #19304)

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Let me know if the code is consistent with community standards (not 100% sure about indentation of chained jQuery actions)

I don't think this MR warrants any unit tests or documentation, but let me know if you disagree.  I'll add the requisite CHANGELOG entry upon approval.

## Why was this MR needed?

Currently, if a discussion is accessed via a permalink to an ""outdated"" diff discussion, the anchor will not bring you to the expected part of the page.

Ensure all javascripts use GitLab install directory as the cookie path.

## What does this MR do?

Fixes #20435 and standardizes all JavaScript-set cookies to use the same root url.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Nothing I can think of.  This MR is pretty straight forward.

## Why was this MR needed?

Cookie paths were inconsistent across front-end scripts.  Some would default to '/' and others had no set path and would end up tied to whatever page they were set on.  Also as @connorshea noted, we cannot assume GitLab is installed at '/'.

Perhaps a better way to refactor out the common haml code

Adding it to all to keep the UI consistency and to offer mobile users a better interface

Add font color contrast to external label in admin area

## What does this MR do?
Adds a darker font color to `.label-default` so that the labels have more contrast

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
~~I used the same font color as the `.badge` on that same page but it was not listed as a variable in `variables.scss`. I'm not sure if both references need to be added as a sass variable or whether they should be replaced with an existing color in the variables list.~~

In reference to [Dmitriy's note about the colors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20114#note_13251919), I changed the color to `$btn-transparent-color` and also took the liberty to change it on the navigation badges as well.

Improves existing UI

Fix markdown help references

## What does this MR do?
Replaces all `markdown/markdown` references with `user/markdown` since `markdown/markdown.md` has been replaced with `user/markdown.md`

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Shouldn't be any :smile: 

## Why was this MR needed?
So that users who click on markdown help don't have to click/redirect to another link to get to the markdown help page

Closes #21434

lib/backup: fix broken permissions when creating repo dir

## What does this MR do?

This MR fixes an issue where gitlab:backup:restore will not work because the repositories directory is set up with bad permissions. The bad permissions will prevent access to the repositories by the git user, causing all kinds of troubles (e.g. gitlab-shell won't install hooks).

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?

Rake task gitlab:backup:restore would complete successfully, but gitlab:check will report errors and gitlab cannot access repos.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

Fix resolving conflicts on forks

## What does this MR do?

When we resolve conflicts, we create a merge commit in the source branch with parents `[source_branch_head, target_branch_head]`. But when the MR is from a fork, `target_branch_head` might not exist in the source repo at all, so we need to fetch it if it isn't there. We can do this locally so it should be fast.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The `TestEnv` changes are needed to reset the branch refs if we're reusing a git directory locally - otherwise, there might not be conflicts!

## Why was this MR needed?

It's a bug in a new feature!

Added performance guidelines for new MRs

## What does this MR do?

This MR adds a set of guides that should be followed by merge request authors.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Spelling, grammar, etc

## Why was this MR needed?

There is no set of guidelines one should follow when submitting merge requests. This leads to developers at times disregarding performance. This in turn results in performance specialists having to clean up the mess, or production engineers being woken up in the middle of the night because the database is on fire.

Front End - Rewrote ES5 `user.js` to ES6 `user.js.es6`

## What does this MR do?

This MR removes the `users.js` file in `app/assets/javascripts/users.js` and replaces it with ES6.

* It also adds the file extension `.es6` so that the sprockets babel gem can transpile it to ES5.
* The new file is: `users.js.es6` in `app/assets/javascripts/`
* Replaced `new User` with `new gl.User` in `app/views/users/show.html.haml`

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I followed the AirBnb guide, but if there are any mistakes let me know!

Fix markdown anchor icon interaction

## What does this MR do?
Fixes and improves the markdown anchor icon interaction so that hovering over any headers (generated through markdown) will have an anchor icon that's easily accessible (won't hide from you on edge cases), replaced the icon with fontAwesome icon and added more padding for the anchor icon.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
1.  Need to check if it's okay to replace the icon-link.png with fontAwesome
2. Need to check if it's okay for the additional view padding on views that render markdown to compensate for anchor link space
3. Need to check if there are any other views that render markdown that did not have it's padding re-adjusted

Improve markdown rendered anchor links so that they are more user friendly

While adding HipChat integration I noticed that no messages are being displayed after clicking on ""Save changes"" button. I looked into code and observed that there is a code for these messages which once worked but doesn't work anymore. It's a regression which should be fixed.

Change ""check out, review, and merge locally"" URL to SSH by default.

## What does this MR do?

Change the default URL type  in the ""Check out, review, and merge locally"" pop-up dialog to SSH.

## Why was this MR needed?

The default URL to show on the project screen is the SSH URL, so it makes sense for it to be the default here too. Plus, since most people (hopefully) use SSH keys to avoid typing credentials repeatedly, changing this default means these commands can be pasted into a terminal more easily since no password prompt will get in the way.

Add issues filters reset btn

## What does this MR do?

Adds a button to the issues filter to reset all filters. I also lightly refactored a nearby method.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

At the moment, the user can click the reset button even when no filters have been set. I didn't really like how it looked flashing the link on and off depending on whether a user had added a filter. I prefer having it there all the time, so the user is aware of it. But it wouldn't be difficult to hide if no filters have been set, if that's preferred.

So users can reset filters when they're filtering issues.

Refactor sidebar logic for more predictable behavior

## What does this MR do?

Fixes a few bugs with the sidebar and ""pin"" functionality:

1. Pinned state would get reset when loading a page with a viewport smaller than 1024px (#19183)
2. Toggle buttons could occasionally end up in an invalid state in which the toggle is hidden from view at the same time the sidebar is collapsed.
    ![2016-09-03-09.39.07](/uploads/75d9a836ab58aae9f89f38cc29e90bbd/2016-09-03-09.39.07.gif)

3. Clicking outside the sidebar to trigger 'collapse' when below the 1024px breakpoint would work only if not pinned, even though pin status should only effect the sidebar above the 1024px breakpoint.
4. Code confusing with no single source of truth for the state of the sidebar.  Sometimes pinned state is inferred from the cookie, sometimes from the DOM.  Code to handle these functions was confusingly split across both `sidebar.js` and `application.js` for no apparent reason.

I've created a singleton ES6 class to handle the sidebar DOM manipulations, using the properties `isExpanded` and `isPinned` as the canonical state and providing a `renderState` method to sync the DOM with this state whenever it needs updating.  This avoids the possibility of invalid states caused by reliance on jQuery `toggleClass()` methods and makes the code much more readable/maintainable.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

It is a substantial rewrite, so I could use another set of eyes to make sure nothing was left behind from the original implementation.

## Why was this MR needed?

I initially intended to just fix #19183 by modifying the code in place, but it proved to be a difficult mess and rather than add to the technical debt it made sense to write a more readable implementation of the sidebar functionality.

Fix API issues sorting

## What does this MR do?

Fix the sorting of issues in the API.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Instead of removing the '_at' suffix manually, we could add those versions to the `Sortable` concern instead.

## Why was this MR needed?

There were a couple of bugs:

* The global and project-specific issues endpoints wouldn't sort at all.
* Group sorting would work, but only if you applied two undocumented workarounds:
  * Always pass both `order_by` and `sort` (both are optional, so only one should be needed to change ordering).
  * Instead of passing `created_at` or `updated_at`, you needed to pass `created` or `updated`.

This makes the API implementation match the docs.

Change response for /ci/api/v1/builds/register.json from 404 to 204

## What does this MR do?

To check if there are new builds scheduled for a runner, runner is sending `POST /ci/api/v1/builds/register.json` requests. If there is a build then a `200` response with build data is returned. However if there is no builds scheduled for this runner it receives a `404 Not Found` response. This may end with a lot of `404 Not Found` lines in logs that are an expected behavior (please read #14445 for a reference).

Since `v1.0.1` version GitLab Runner is ready to receive a `204 No Content` response in case of no builds.

This MR adds a support for this status code for each Runner's version that can be determined while handling `POST /ci/api/v1/builds/register.json` request.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Specs in `spec/requests/ci/api/builds_spec.rb`

Don't consult or change the global and system git configuration

## What does this MR do?

Writes a hard-coded `gitconfig` file per build and sets it in `$GIT_CONFIG`.

## Why was this MR needed?

Previously, we were running `git config --global fetch.recurseSubmodules false"" to disable recursive submodule fetches. This has a few problems:

* It modifies global state for the user the runner is under, which is unexpected in some environments
* Concurrent builds sometimes fail as `git config` doesn't cleanly handle concurrent writes to the same file.

This change switches to a separate gitconfig file per-build, with hardcoded values. This solves both issues, at the cost of removing support for setting custom options for the runner in /etc/gitconfig or ~/.gitconfig.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

* Do we need to support /etc/gitconfig or ~/.gitconfig (or the Windows equivalents)? Do we know if users are relying on this secret feature at the moment?

Update snippets UI

## What does this MR do?

Updates snippets UI _(mainly mobile view)_ to new UI proposed in #18849.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Does anyone know the implementation difference between `app/views/snippets/show.html.haml` and `app/views/projects/snippets/show.html.haml`? I have only been updating the latter as it's the only one I can find implemented. I assume the former is rendered somewhere seeing as there is controllers for it too. But this doesn't seem very DRY from my current perspective.

Replace contributions calendar timezone payload with dates

## What does this MR do?
Fixes a ~regression bug introduced in !5784 whereby the calendar squares would not render due to a timezone mismatch between the server timezone and the browser (user) timezone. I am now returning the dates instead of the timezone from the backend. There's a good chance we will still have a calendar off by one error (which is an existing issue #1943) but passing dates should make sure that the calendar activity squares render correctly across timezones.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Double check that this displays the correct calendar squares when the GitLab instance is hosted in a different timezone than the user viewing it

## Why was this MR needed?
Fixes ~regression issue :disappointed:

Fixes labels multi-encode and selecting labels with single quotes

## What does this MR do?

Replaced single quotes with escaped single quotes when setting item `.is-active` and when removing its field.

Adds a test to test selecting 2 different labels _(one with a single quote)_ with a full page load inbetween, it checks the labels are selected as well as shown as `.is-active` in the list.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?



## Why was this MR needed?

The javascript handles the url encoding when it is sent to the server so we shouldn't let the javascript begin processing an already encoded string but we needed to stop single quotes from breaking a jquery selector.

Frontend for Merge Request Diff

This merge request improves the UX for the merge request diff feature which was recently implemented here (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/6127). Specifically, it styles various parts of the diff feature to match the designs, it disables comment-related buttons in states where comments are disabled, and it adds a 'Show latest version' button for convenience.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I could use feedback on this MR's fidelity to the design.  

## Why was this MR needed?

Neccessary styling improvements for basic UX of this feature, and enabled comment buttons are not functional and thus need to be disabled in certain states.

Use git-init templates (clone) and git config without --global (fetch) to disable recurseSubmodules

## What does this MR do?

The Runner unconditionally disables submodules for the repository it is working on. This commit:

* Stops doing this using `git config --global`
* For fetch, uses `git config` after `git init`
* For clone, uses a custom git template directory to apply the config to the created .git/config file

## Why was this MR needed?

Using `git config --global` modifies the user's ~/.gitconfig, which is surprising (you may want to test the runner using your own user, for instance). For Git 1.7.1, which is the minimum version we need to support, a custom template directory is the only feasible way to get `git clone` to respect custom configuration directives at fetch time. 

An alternative would be to re-implement git clone by running the plumbing commands in the correct sequence.

Fix range mismatch handling error while patch tracing

## What does this MR do?

This MR adds some tests for trace patching and fix a bug that finishes with a `panic` while handling a range mismatch in some situations.

## Why was this MR needed?

We've had a situation where the same build was triggered second time by GItLab. In GitLab the build trace was 17041 bytes long while the repeated build trace was only 66 bytes long. We've had a `RangeMismatch` response, so the offset was updated (to 17041) and `client.PatchTrace` was repeated, at it was planned. Unfortunately the `tracePatch` struct was  not resistant to a situation when the offset is set to a value bigger than trace's length. This MR fixes such situation, adds a test to guard us from regressions and adds some other tests for trace patching feature.

## What does this MR do?

Adds removing of `.git/index.lock` file before doing a `git fetch`.

## Why was this MR needed?

We're removing the `.git/index.lock` file just before doing a `git checkout` command. However this can still be a problem when the project is using the `fetch` strategy. In such case the `git fetch` will fail because of existing `.git/index.lock` file (see #1166).

Thanks @zeiv for this!

>This fixes #20463 by adding the .emoji-search class to the ""Search results"" h5 element.  AwardsHandler.prototype.setupSearch() was trying to remove the element before creating a new one, but wasn't because the it was attempting to select it with the .emoji-search class, which wasn't being added.

Added soft wrap option to editor

## What does this MR do?

Adds a `Soft wrap` button to the editor, when clicked, it wraps the text in the editor and changes to `No wrap`, then when clicked, it unwraps the text in the editor.

This will also detect files with no extension, `.txt` or `.md` and proactively set the soft wrap. **Unless**, you explicitly toggle the soft wrap, then it will stop checking the file path and will stay with the users explicit preference.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

We should talk about the `.txt` and `.md` thing, [I'm not sure if its a good approach](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/18297#note_14918218).

The pipeline adds a step which builds and releases Runner's docker images. It also fixes a problem when a release (both docker-based and S3-based) for older stable branch was marked as the `latest`.

Please look into #1713 and #1681 for a reference.

Fixed Session Cookie header

## What does this MR do?

This MR fixes the wiki text header for the Session Cookie section

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

It is markdown so probably not. Two very simple changes - first is replacing a dot with a space (was causing invalid markdown, not rendered as a header) and capitalized the word Cookie to match the other header formatting.

## Why was this MR needed?

Fix the wiki documentation.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

None.

## Does this MR meet the acceptance criteria?

I can't imagine it wouldn't.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?

This was needed to fix the poor UX highlighted in #22221, where opening the dropdown showed an initially filtered set of results because the dropdown toggle was the dropdown filter itself. The compare page is always loaded with `master` as each branch/tag selection, so when opening the dropdown, it would only show results matching `master`.

document the need to be owner or have the master permission level for the initial push

## What does this MR do?

It documents the new behavior as discussed on gitlab-org/gitlab-ce#22543, because the `/protected_branch` URL of empty repository is not available and could mislead users.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Don't think so

## Why was this MR needed?

When you create a repository on GitLab, command line instructions on its home page for the use case _""Existing folder or Git repository""_ invite you to `git push -u origin master`, but the very first push is now rejected if you are not `Owner` or attributed `Master` permission.

Ensure the 'fixed layout' preference is honored whenever possible

## What does this MR do?

Currently, when viewing any Merge Request the user's fixed-layout preference is overridden if they have set ""Side-by-Side"" view as their preference when viewing diffs.  This makes sense if they are currently viewing a diff, but this is confusing when their layout preference is overridden while they are on another tab (i.e. ""Discussion"" or ""Builds"").

This MR moves all responsibility for overriding the fixed layout from the Ruby page layout helper into frontend JavaScript where it is only applied when needed.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Check that nothing broke for users which have their layout preference set to ""Fluid"" as well as those which have it set to ""Fixed"".  I've already done this but double checking is always good idea :smile:.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes #22343 

## Other Notes

As @lbennett noted in #22343, this is something of a band-aid.  It fixed most of the issue, but we still need to have a discussion about whether or not is acceptable to override user layout preferences for ""Side-by-Side"" views in general.  At least this MR limits the scope of this behavior to a single tab within an MR or merge conflict page.

Allows users to enable debug tracing during builds, using `set -o xtrace`, `@echo on` and `Set-PSDebug -Trace 1`, respectively.

Debugging failures partway through the execution of a generated script is currently tricky, as any one of a number of commands could have failed. Enabling this feature for a failing build will ease the process considerably.

Refactor remnants of CoffeeScript destructured opts and super into ES6

## What does this MR do?

Gets rid of some CoffeeScript remnants that are difficult to work with, and updates them to use ES6 syntax/constructs. I updated nearby code to ES6, but these updates usually just included using the es6 class syntax and scoped variable keywords. 

**Important**: For the most part, I tried to avoid refactoring the design of the existing code. If I attempted that, this would've taken much much longer and it would've been out of this issue's scope. 

## Why was this MR needed?

The compiled coffeescript for destructured default params is very difficult to work in.

Prevent flash alert text from being obscured when container is fluid

## What does this MR do?

Fixes [a regression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/a2af7790) that causes the text within server-initiated flash *alerts* (not flash *notices*) to be obscured when `.container-fluid` is applied. It was reported in relation to a cherry-picking flash alert, but the problem occurs with all server-initiated flash alerts contained by a fluid container. 

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Note that as part of this fix, I combined some duplicate code and removed `.flash-text` & `.content-wrapper` selectors as they didn't seem to be necessary.
 
I manually tested JS-initiated Flash alerts to make sure this doesn't affect their appearance. I also grepped around for anything else that might depend on these styles. Everything checked out. But... can *you* see something this is going to break?

## Why was this MR needed?

Affected users can't read flash alerts.

Only hide deploy status external link on x-small screens.

## What does this MR do?

Fixes [a regression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/03ea01946524a74773b24430c81804c2724b84b6#68dead621eaa630b5150a4d71b59fa3cd19030fd_57_50) where the deploy status widget hides only the text within the widget, and only for screens within bootstrap's 'small' range (‚â•544px - <768px).
 
## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I changed the viewport width range to hide the widget from `sm` to `xs` because when the external link is removed, it seems to fit comfortably even on xs viewports. 

Given that we were already hiding the external link (along with all of the deploy text) on `sm` viewports, I assume it's okay to hide the external link still, instead of wrapping it to a new line. 

We could remove the conditional hiding altogether though, and allow the external link to wrap. Definitely doesn't look as nice, but if it's important to show the external link along with the deploy status, we could make it look better when it wraps.

## Why was this MR needed?

Looked buggy, and prevented context being given for build passed icon on smaller screens.

Move user#show and group#show routing under root url

## What does this MR do?

Changes routing so user#show and group#show routing is under root url 

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

no

## Why was this MR needed?

For nice and consistent routing  for user/group show pages:

| before | after| 
|---|---|
| `/u/dzaporozhets` | `/dzaporozhets`| 
| `/dzaporozhets/gitlab-ce` |`/dzaporozhets/gitlab-ce`| 
| `/u/dzaporozhets/snippets` |`/u/dzaporozhets/snippets`| 
| `/groups/gitlab-org`|  `/gitlab-org`| 
| `/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce`|  `/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce`| 
| `/groups/gitlab-org/issues `|  `/groups/gitlab-org/issues `| 

So show page for user and group shown as `/:name` which is much nicer than before. At same time all nested pages like group issues stays under REST `/groups/:name/issues` so we don't need to introduce extra name restrictions ( ex. case when group has project with name ""issues"")

Update Gitlab Shell to fix errors moving projects between storages

## What does this MR do?

Update Gitlab Shell to fix errors moving projects between storages

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

No

## Why was this MR needed?

We are unable to move projects using `ionice` because of an error in the current version of gitlab-shell. This brings the changes of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/merge_requests/96 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/merge_requests/97

Correct namespace validation to forbid bad names #21077

## What does this MR do?
Updates master namespace regex to forbid any namespace ending in `.git` or `.atom` and corrects and adds relevant tests

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
I think it's all good. I could use help with the creation of tests for usernames with trailing `.atom` or `.git` as the testing framework is a bit over my head.

## Why was this MR needed?
A group that ends in `.atom` will cause the relevent dashboard to crash if the user (ANY user, not just the creator) has visibility of the group until it is deleted through the admin panel (it cannot be renamed, the edit page will crash. It may be fixable through the API, that wasn't checked.)

This allows a malicious user with group creation privileges to bulk add users to a group, rename the group to a bad name, and crash the groups dashboard for all members of the group. The same applies if the group is internal or public and users navigate to the explore tab of the groups dashboard.

The same applies to usernames ending in `.atom`.

In many places of the code, it implies that `.git` in not allowed at the end of namespaces, but many allowed it anyway. This MR forbids it everywhere to prevent potential issues (like the one with `.atom` going forward).

## What are the relevant issue numbers?
Group path validation incomplete, crashes groups dashboard #21077

## What does this MR do?
Changes the version of `github-markup` gem we are using, to be the forked one with the changes to enable python3 support.
The change is backward compatible with users using Python 2, and will only be running with Python 3 in Omnibus (with the help of a custom patch we apply there).

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Make sure backward compatibility isn't broken for source installs.

Use defined colour for a language when available

## What does this MR do?

This MR changes the colours of the different languages in the language graph.  It now uses the colour set in Linguist instead of the first six characters of the SHA256'd language name where possible.  If Linguist has no colour defined for a given language, it falls back to the old method of finding a colour.

CE to EE merge check rake task

## What does this MR do?

This merge request adds a Rake task that checks whether the current branch can be merged cleanly to EE/master.

If not, it checks if a `<ce_branch>-ee` branch exists in EE, tries to merge it to EE/master and then tries to merge `ce_branch` to EE/master.

If the result of the check is that the current branch cannot be merged cleanly to EE/master, the job will fail, display troubleshooting steps, and a warning will be shown in the merge request.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Probably the steps I used to do the various checks, and also the steps I suggest to create an EE-specific branch.

## Why was this MR needed?

The goal is to catch as early as possible the possible conflicts a CE MR will cause when CE/master will be merged to EE/master. This way, the developer is warned that he/she should open a MR against EE before or as soon as the CE is merged. In the end, this should lower the work of the CE->EE merger.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Replace unique keyframes mixin with specific keyframe animation names

## What does this MR do?
Replaces `unique-keyframes` mixin with `include-keyframes` mixin

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Shouldn't be :thumbsup_tone1: 

## Why was this MR needed?
Some users had GitLab hosted in a distributed environment that makes `unique-keyframes` a non-viable implementation. 
The randomized animation names from `unique-keyframes` was not being picked up by the different servers which resulted in 404 errors.

When reading conflicts:

1. Add a `type` field. `text` works as before, and has `sections`;
   `text-editor` is a file with ambiguous conflict markers that can only
   be resolved in an editor.
2. Add a `content_path` field pointing to a JSON representation of the
   file's content for a single file.
3. Hitting `content_path` returns a similar datastructure to the `file`,
   but without the `content_path` and `sections` fields, and with a
   `content` field containing the full contents of the file (with
   conflict markers).

When writing conflicts:

1. Instead of `sections` being at the top level, they are now in a
   `files` array. This matches the read format better.
2. The `files` array contains file hashes, each of which must contain:
   a. `new_path`
   b. `old_path`
   c. EITHER `sections` (which works as before) or `content` (with the
      full content of the resolved file).

Improve tabbing usability for sign in page

## What does this MR do?
Rearranged the html elements so that the `sign in` button gets tabbed first before the other elements and used CSS to rearrange the visual layout.

I did not use `tabindex` because it does not play well with screen readers and is not recommended from an accessibility standpoint.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

*  Need to make sure that there aren't any side effects to my code change. `.new_user` seemed to be automatically added through `form_for()` and I'm not sure if there will be other cases where `.new_user` is used where there is no sign in page with forget your password.

Resolve Merge conflicts in editor

## What does this MR do?

This is the second iteration of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20344 which now allows to resolve conflicts manually providing an editor to the user.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

- Previous implementation has been refactored almost from the ground up.
- Also some components like `parallel-conflict-lines` has been optimized to work well with PhantomJS.
- The app and files required files are loaded only when needed. `merge_conflicts_bundle.js` is only loaded in `/<group>/<project>/merge_requests/<Id>/conflicts` only

## Why was this MR needed?

Some MRs were unable to be solved interactively in the UI, with this MR we let the user to manually fix complex merge request conflicts.

## What does this MR do?

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

A few sites use be_within(2.seconds) or 5.minutes - I didn't change those

## Why was this MR needed?

A custom matcher helps to document that we need to compare times loosely, and keeps the fudge factor from being declared in multiple places.

Use git clone --no-checkout and git checkout --force

## What does this MR do?

Adds --no-checkout to `git clone` and -f to `git checkout`

## Why was this MR needed?

On a case-insensitive filesystem, mixed-case commits can unconditionally break both clone and fetch, as the initial, implicit checkout of `HEAD` in `git clone`immediately modifies the working tree, which causes the later `git checkout` to fail (without -f). `--no-checkout` skips the implicit checkout, and should be fine in all circumstances.

With the fetch strategy, this still isn't enough as the case-insensitivity-caused change persists, and the checkout for the second build fails. `-f` forces it to proceed, ""overwriting"" the local changes. This also prevents local modifications brought about by CR/LF differences, or others not caught by the `git clean` and `git reset`, from breaking the fetch strategy.

Both these arguments are present in git v1.6.1

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Are there circumstances where we want the build to fail, that `git checkout -f` would in fact succeed in? I can't think of any offhand.

## What does this MR do?

Renames `machineDetails` struct to `MachineDetails` in `executors/docker/machine/details.go` (and all usages).

## Why was this MR needed?

When using Runner in autoscale mode, when the machine is removed **and** log level is set to `debug`, we're saving details to a yaml file: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/master/executors/docker/machine/details.go#L52.

The problem is resolved, when the struct element `machineDetails` is exported. I'm not sure if the problem is caused by updating `gopkg.in/yaml.v1` to `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` or by migrating to go 1.7.

Also, as part of this fix, I removed applications of `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: auto` in two other places where they're no longer needed. One was the file-holder. I made sure I could reproduce the behavior this was intended to fix, and then made sure this MR still fixed it. 

Here's the errant behavior:

Fix a 500 error viewing an MR with a deleted source project

## What does this MR do?

Allows merged MRs to be shown without any 500 errors if the source project is removed

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/31c37c6c38258684fc92e0d91119c33872e39034 fixed this for closed MRs only. I had trouble understanding the introduced helper and logic, so reverted it and keyed everything on the existence of the source project or branch directly.

commits.json returns a 500 error for a closed or merged MR; the approach taken in the above MR was to hide the commits... tab, so I've run with that.

For merged MRs, the commits (but not the pipeline data) are in the target project, so we *could* do better, but it's a fairly nasty intervention to make it happen.

## Why was this MR needed?

Viewing merged MRs should work even if the fork they came from has been deleted or unlinked.

Improve registration behavior

## What does this MR do?

1. Adds support for some executor advanced options (like autoscaling settings) while registering. Currently some options that we can use from command line (eg. `gitlab-runner register --machine-name ""auto-scaled-%s"" ...`) are not saved to `config.toml` file.

2. Makes `config.toml` file more clean after runner's registration. Generally it removes parts for non-used executors (which before this MR are present as toml headers for sections with some default values) and marks some kubernetes options with `omitempty`/`omitzero`.

## Why was this MR needed?

1. Makes registration more usable for scripting and adds support for missing options. 2. Is a nice, non-critical improvement :wink:

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Which `KubernetesConfig` fields should be really set to `omitempty` and which not? I don't have any experience with Kubernetes so I chosen this guided by a hunch.

Stop injecting field errors where they won't be used.

Filters the form elements which gl_field_errors validates, excluding input types button, submit and checkbox.

## Why was this MR needed?

This won't make a difference in UX, but I just noticed that we are currently validating and injecting errors into the DOM for all non-hidden inputs. Doing so is unnecessary, and could introduce performance problems on forms with larger numbers of inputs.

Fix `User#to_reference`

## What does this MR do?

Fix the method signature of `User#to_reference` so that moving an issue with a user reference does not throw a ""invalid number of arguments"" exception.

## Why was this MR needed?

1. Changes in 8.13 require `Referable`s that don't have a project
   reference to accept two arguments - `from_project` and
   `target_project`.

2. `User#to_reference` was not changed to accept the
   `target_project` (even though it is not used). Moving an issue
   containing a user reference would throw a ""invalid number of
   arguments"" exception.

3. The regression was introduced in [c8b2b3f7](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/c8b2b3f7c32db873f1bebce3e3b1847ea24d235f#91fabb7ad88bd2fde6fef1c100a719c00e503047_75_79), which expects
   all `Referable`s that don't respond to `:project` to have a `to_reference`
   method that takes two arguments.

Tidied up pipelines.js.es6 and removed jQuery where acceptable.

## What does this MR do?

A week or so ago, I made some changes to `pipeline.js` as it was a single function and we now needed to expand on the JS logic for pipelines. I decided to turn it into `class Pipelines` of `pipelines.js.es6`. To avoid review confusion I held back from changing the pre-existing function so it dealt with instance members. Every time you click the button it would re-query all the elements it needed, now its a class it doesn't need that as we can store the required elements on construction.

Make issues search less finicky

## What does this MR do?

1. Tracks issues search pristine-ness, to ignore non-mutating keyups.
2. Increase debounce wait on issues search execution from 500ms to 1000ms.
3. Ensures issues search retains focus after search execution

Note: Issues search is being overhauled (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21747), so most (if not all) of these changes will no longer be used. But given that the overhaul has been pushed back a release (8.14?), it makes sense to do some quick fixes to improve UX in the meantime.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Will adding autofocus to the search input create unforeseen problems?

## Why was this MR needed?

- At the moment, issues search is run on any keyup, even if search terms remain the same. This is an oversight that is both a tax on servers and an annoyance to users. 

- Searches are executed pretty quickly after a gap in keyups. It's too fast according to internal and enterprise customer feedback.

- Focus is lost when a search is conducted, so you have to either tab to (any sane person would not do this, given our tab order) or reach for the mouse and select the input again. 

These are all pretty heavily complained about issues that are, to quote community users, ""rage-inducing"" and ""major accessibility issue[s]"".

Replace jquery-cookie plugin with js-cookie

## What does this MR do?

Removes an outdated and unmaintained dependency [jquery.cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie) with its successor [js.cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) which is not dependent on jQuery.

Also this MR adds a global default cookie `path` setting which defaults to the GitLab root directory.  Now, setting a cookie to any path other than `gon.relative_url_root` requires an explicit opt-out.  This is a sensible default and should prevent accidental omission going forward.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Double check that all instances of `$.cookie(x)` have been replaced by `Cookies.get(x)` and all instances of `$.cookie(x, y, z)` are replaced with `Cookies.set(x, y, z)`.  All javascripts which set or retrieve cookie values should function just as before.

## Why was this MR needed?

One more step toward shaking off jQuery as a dependency (#23022), also [jquery.cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie) is no longer maintained and hasn't seen an update in 2+ years.

Add todo toggle event

## What does this MR do?
Adds a custom jQuery event `todo:toggle` to detect when a new todo is added so that the respective todo counters (header navigation and sidebar) can update as needed

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

*  I wasn't sure whether each `spec` should be modularized based on the html templates or whether they should be separated based on function. There are some crossovers between the `dashboard_spec` and the `header_spec`.
* The naming conventions for `sidebar` and `right_sidebar` were a little confusing since they were named the opposite in their `specs`. I made a few assumptions and named a few files based on what I thought they should be named. I'd be happy to change it to something else though :smile:  

## Why was this MR needed?
This resolves an existing issue where the todo count on the sidebar would not update (until refresh) and refactors the existing methods that are used to update the todo counters (header navigation and sidebar)

Tests failing on master. RSpec executes inner `before` blocks after outer `before` blocks, so the second note was being added *after* loading the page, and then being pulled in by running JS on the page, causing intermittent failures if we clicked the resolve button before the note was loaded.

## What does this MR do?

This MR adds the ability to `forceLoad` a collapsed diff from instantiation, on top of this, if it is force loaded, we can pass a callback function to be invoked when the content is loaded.

Now when a MR is loaded, we check for a diff line anchor that is currently within a collapsed diff, we re-instantiate the `singleFileDiff` with the `forceLoad` option. We also pass a callback function that in responsible for highlighting and scrolling to the specified anchor.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?

We currently cannot anchor link to collapsed diff lines as the do not auto-expand.

Add initial Prometheus metrics server to runner manager

## What does this MR do?

This adds a new `metrics_server` config option. If set to a listening address, a Prometheus HTTP server is started with the following metrics:

- runner business logic metrics (currently only number of currently running builds)
- build version information
- Go process metrics (GC stats, goroutines, memstats, ...)
- general process metrics (FDs, memory, cpu usage, ...)

A full example `/metrics` output can be found here: https://gist.github.com/juliusv/5a1972875e9d80654c63d222c480f87e

This depends on the data race fix in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/merge_requests/352, so it's based ontop of that.

The approach to integrating the `metrics_server` configuration option was taken from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/merge_requests/219.

## Why was this MR needed?

We need better insight into the entire CI system, and currently we have no white-box metrics.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

### General metrics approach

There were multiple different ways of approaching this. The more ""traditional"" Prometheus style is to just register all metrics from anywhere in the codebase in the global default Prometheus registry (similar to how logging is often treated as a global concern without dependency-injecting a logger; and analogous to using `http.Handle(...)` to register a handler with the global HTTP mux).

However, from reading the rest of this codebase, it seemed to me like an approach with explicit dependencies and less global state would be preferred by the authors. So I'm instantiating a custom Prometheus metrics registry and registering the Go and process metrics collectors with it manually (those are included automatically in the default metrics registry). I also am using the `prometheus.Collector` interface to encapsulate the metrics of a type, instead of the simpler approach of just defining global metrics. For an example of the latter, see the example at the top of https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus. Generally, this all leads to somewhat more code, but more explicit dependencies and encapsulation.

### Configuration reloading

Like in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/merge_requests/219, the metrics HTTP server does not allow for reconfiguration. In Go, it's also not trivial to stop an already running HTTP server. So right now, only whatever is configured at process startup takes effect. Is that ok? Should it be a command-line flag instead?

Please let me know if this approach is generally going in the right direction. I know there's many other metrics we will want to add over time, but maybe let's start out simple?

I changed the padding of the list to 0 and gave the 8px top and bottom padding from the `ul` to the `first-child` and `last-child` li elements inside the list. Is that okey. Reason why, is that it breaks the list off correctly at the edges:)

* This is written to avoid the need for a database migration, so it is`serialize :repository_storage` without `, Array`. This is tested, but alternatives include:
  * Add a database migration
  * Write a custom Coder that will accept a String or Array in `load` and always `dump an Array.

Add missing security specs for raw snippet access

## What does this MR do?
It extends the project snippets access security specs to cover raw snippet paths as well.

When I was researching snippets for !7256, I noticed that specs existed for the HTML show view of project snippets but not the raw view. Seeing as this is a spec that is checking for access regressions on places where sensitive information might be kept, I thought it would be a good idea to cover the raw snippets access too.

To balance out the karma of adding in extra tests I also changed the tests to all use an `empty_project` spec.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

With the aim of making the specs easier to read, I restructured some of them to use context blocks for each type of snippet.

I've used the same access rights defined for the show snippet paths for the raw snippet access. 

## Why was this MR needed?

To catch security regressions on raw snippet access for projects.

## What does this MR do?

This MR smoothes the UX of the builds page by more effectively affixing the scroll step buttons.

It also ensures the scroll step buttons are always in view, even if the sidemenu is open.

It also moves the autoscroll button into the same container as the scroll buttons.

Remove project_title additions from builds and environments

## What does this MR do?

Removed soon-to-be un-needed project title additions from builds and environments.

**This MR depends on !5998, which introduces subnav to these pages. Without it we're just removing a useful link.**

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

@iamphill Is this right of me? One of these still exists in `projects/artifacts/browse`, I'm not sure whether to fix the issue with `project_title`, which already has some issues with its chevron, or just remove it as it will soon be redundant.

It's my first contribution to GitLab so I might need some help:

 - I'm loading a yaml file in the controller. I'm not sure where would be the best place to put it.
 - I'm also having the error below running the tests but it doesn't seem related to my changes. I think I might have some issue with my config. Could you double check if the tests pass for you?

Move 'Search Snippets' Spinach feature to Rspec

## What does this MR do?
Moves the Spinach feature `features/snippet_search.feature` to an RSpec feature `spec/features/snippets/search_snippets_spec.rb`.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

The search results page URL was being visited directly in the original Spinach test, using an encoded search query and specific parameters to trigger the snippet searches. I have changed the RSpect feature to fill in the search box on the snippets dashboard page to retrieve results to cover the missing test coverage on the search box and to avoid the feature test from relying on the implementation details of the search URL structure.

## Why was this MR needed?

As part of deprecating the Spinach test suite.

Resolve ""Create a tab shortcut to jump directly to content""

## What does this MR do?
Adds accessibility shortcut to page, i.e. if user hits `tab` key right after the page is loaded and user has not interacted to any part of the page, the shortcut appears at top left corner of the page. Then, pressing `enter` (`spacebar` support is WIP) scrolls page to focus on content.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
See if `id` attribute added to `.content` element (present in [_page.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/app/views/layouts/_page.html.haml)) needs to be reviewed if it is correct approach or we already have an ID that shortcut can refer to.

## Why was this MR needed?
This feature is particularly useful for screen readers where user doesn't have to go through entire nav to reach content of page.

Fix broken commit metadata loading for large repository trees

## What does this MR do?

Fixes a regression introduced in !7208 in which a call to `ajaxGet()` would fail when loading metadata for large repository trees.

This call produced no errors in the console because it is contained in a sort of `eval` block in jQuery.  This is an ugly, easily broken method for loading data asynchronously whose problems were exemplified by this issue.  I'm opening a separate issue (#24660) to alter this implementation.

## Why was this MR needed?

The failing AJAX call was causing metadata to stop loading, and the `timeago` functionality to stop running due to script failure.

Resolve ""Activity entries are not loaded fully to cover full window's height""

## What does this MR do?

Fixes a bug in which a browser window large enough to encompass the default number of items in an auto-loading endless-scroll list could not trigger the loading of additional items.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I refactored activities.js and pager.js into es6 syntax while I was investigating the issue.  No changes were made other than some es6 flourishes and eslint conformity, so nothing should be effected, but perhaps best to double check other pages which utilize these scripts.

Add PullPolicy config option for kubernetes

Allows the user so specify a image pull policy for build-images used (like with the docker executor).

May speed up CI steps when using versioned build images (rather than :latest)

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
I'm unsure about the code duplication in `common/config.go`. Maybe it would be better/more clean to map the docker syntax for `pull_policy` to kubernetes values?

2. `SmartInterval`-- for configurable polling
3. `PrettyTime` -- time parsing and formatting utility methods

Simplify copy on ""Create a new list"" dropdown in Issue Boards

## What does this MR do?

It changes the ""Create new list"" text to simply ""Add list"". It also describes the operation in a more concise way. It was suggested in #24659.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Although I refactored references to the name of the button to reflect the new text, I left part of the documentation unmodified:

File: `doc/user/project/issue_board.md`
```
In short, here's a list of actions you can take in an Issue Board:                 
                                                                                   
- [Create a new list](#creating-a-new-list).                                       
- [Delete an existing list](#deleting-a-list). 
```
because I was not sure if changing those was necessary.


Additionally, I replaced every occurrence of `click_button 'Create new list'` with `click_button 'Add list'`in the spec. I'm not sure if that causes any change in behavior as I am not sure if there are any hooks to the previous name, explicitly.

File: `spec/features/boards/boards_spec.rb`

## Why was this MR needed?

It is an improvement, as suggested in #24659

Improvement/make pull policies clear

## What does this MR do?

Describes the usage details and cases of `pull_policy` parameters: `always`, `if-not-present` and `never`. It also change code a little to remove unused policy check and log specific exceptions to make clear what and why happened while determining the pulling policy.

## Why was this MR needed?

After adding support for private docker images in !386 and fixing inconsistence of behavior of `always` pull policy we introduced a change that breaks workflows based on previous bad implementation of `always` pull policy handling.

Allow dots in group names to pass validation for Create Group and Edit Group forms

## What does this MR do?
Allows dots within group names to pass form validation when creating or editing a group.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
Nope, pretty straight forward.

## Why was this MR needed?
Although group names with dots are allowed, our frontend validation mistakenly invalidates them

Homogenize sort and filter dropdown toggles

## What does this MR do?

Homogenizes the style of *filter* and *sort* dropdown toggles (aka buttons) related to:
- *issues* (index, new & edit views)
- *issue boards* (index);
- *merge requests* (index, new, edit);
- *projects* (index and ""explore"");
- *projects admin* (index);
- *groups* (show and ""explore"");
- *groups admin* (index);
- *users admin* (index);
- *todos* (index);
- *branches* (index);
- *commits* (index);
- *cycle analytics*;
- *network*;
- *forks*;
- *tags* (index);
- *global search*

Some other dropdowns are incidently concerned:
- project admin (show);
- assigne/due date/milestone/label dropdowns on the issue and board sidebars;
- stage dropdown on the build sidebar;
- merge request and comparison dropdowns for choosing forks and branches;
- ref switcher (e.g. in the blob (show) view or in the graphs view);

Dropdown toggles concerned by #24150 but not covered in this MR:
- Dropdowns for selection MR versions to be compared (in the ""Changes"" tab of an MR);
- Dropdowns that bring up a list of actions:
  - ""Settings"" dropdowns (such as the one found on the upper-right corner of all project pages);
  - The download/action/notifications buttons on the main project page;
  - Dropdowns located inside of list items (on list of pipelines, users and groups, for instance);
  - The ""Options"" button on the commit (show) view;
  - The ""+"" button on the tree explorer (for creating files, branches, tags, ...)

### TODO
- [ ] Update ui.html if needed

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Am I changing any other dropdown toggle than listed above?

## Why was this MR needed?

For #24150

Resolve ""External statuses not shown correctly on pipeline page""

## What does this MR do?

Updates `generic_commit_status/_generic_commit_status.html.haml` template to match the changes made to `ci/builds/_build.html.haml` which had not previously been carried over.

## Testing

1. Ensure updated fixtures are installed (from !7792) so that these changes are made apparent.  (check out the !7792 branch if not yet merged into master, then `bundle exec rake db:drop` and `bundle exec rake dev:setup`)

2. Visit a build list page or an individual pipeline page which contains an external build status.

3. The results should look like this:

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Look for any places where these partials may be rendered to ensure external status match regular build statuses.

## Why was this MR needed?

The generic commit status template has been largely overlooked when changes are made to build table rows which should be duplicated in both places.

Resolve ""Improper use of bootstrap media query variables""

## What does this MR do?

Corrects media queries which are off by `1px` due to incorrect `$screen-{xs,sm,md,lg}-min` usage.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Ensure none of these errors were somehow intentional (I can't imagine a legitimate use case for `@media (max-width: $screen-sm-min)` though)

## Why was this MR needed?

When ""min"" breakpoints are used for ""max-width"" media queries, they create an overlap in rule breakpoints.  For instance in the following scenario:

```scss
.foo {
  @media (min-width: $screen-sm-min) {
    width: 100px;
    padding: 0;
  }
  @media (max-width: $screen-sm-min) {
    padding: 10px 0;
  }
}
```

If the viewport were set to exactly `$screen-sm-min` pixels, both of these media queries would apply.  It is important to use `max-width: $screen-xs-max` in this case which is equal to `$screen-sm-min - 1`.

Resolve ""User-generated permalink IDs collide with GitLab interface""

## What does this MR do?

Prevents ID values automatically generated by headers in [GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#header-ids-and-links) from colliding with IDs used elsewhere in the GitLab interface.  This can cause confusion when, for instance, a selector looks for a merge request tab with `id=""pipelines""` and there is a header with the same ID earlier in the DOM.

How this works:
* All header IDs generated with GitLab Flavored Markdown are namespaced with `id=""user-content_foo""`
* All anchor links which point to these IDs continue to use the non-namespaced hash `<a href=""#foo"">...</a>`
* When a page is loaded or when the `hashchange` event is triggered, javascript will automatically search for `#user-content_foo` if `#foo` cannot be found, and scroll to that position instead.

Pipelines tabs

## What does this MR do?
Changes the URL when the builds tab is clicked making it possible to be shared.

1. Adds a standard way to handle linked tabs:
    *   This behaviour is already present in the merge requests, commit and user `show` page. 
    *    This MR introduces a reusable way to accomplish this behaviour for pages with static content.

2. Adds test:
    *   For the linked tabs reusable class
    *  For the pipelines tabs

## Why was this MR needed?
To allow having a sharable URL that represented the opened tab

Resolve ""Highlighting lines is broken""

## What does this MR do?

Add line highlighting back to diff view.  This was working in the MR ""changes"" tab, but not on a commit page such as https://gitlab.com/winniehell/reproduction-area/commit/9101e66f5761929002956e0f2dd65d7f8643903d

~~This MR also fixes the `scrollToElement` method in `MergeRequestTabs` to account for the extra height of the tab links which are now fixed in place once they are scrolled to the top of the screen.~~ (removed in favor of !7051)

This MR also refactors much of the `Diff` and `MergeRequestTabs` classes to es6 syntax in an effort to increase readability.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Check out both MR ""change"" tabs and commit diff pages and ensure that line highlighting works and that loading a page with one of these permalink hashes correctly highlights and scrolls to the line.

Ensure I didn't break anything in the transition to es6 syntax.  Check the functionality of the tabs on MR pages, as well as diff page interactivity (unfolding hidden lines in diff files, adding comments to diffs, etc).  I have checked these myself, but another set of eyes would be a good idea.

Add pprof HTTP endpoints to metrics server

## What does this MR do?

Adds `pprof` endpoints to existing metrics server, to help debug what's happening with Runner while it is running.

## Why was this MR needed?

In `v1.8.0` we've introduced HTTP metrics server with Prometheus metrics collected while Runner is working. Those information are helpful however we've noticed that in some cases we need to have a detailed information about data flows and function calls inside of a running Runner's process. That's why we've decided to add `pprof` integration.

After merging this MR `pprof` endpoints will be available on the same `host:port` as the integrated metrics server, under the `/debug/pprof/` URI.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

I've analyzed the `net/http/pprof` package to check if importing it (which automatically registers some endpoints to an existing HTTP server) will add any complexity or resources usage overhead. In my opinion it doesn't add anything until the endpoint is called (and only then data is collected). But it would be nice if someone else would look on this.

Fix compatibility with Internet Explorer 11 for merge requests

## What does this MR do?
This merge request restores the compatibility with Internet Explorer 11.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
No.

## Why was this MR needed?
Commit ca3c0c6cd915d44ec2d409b04ab05d964bd5a403 introduced an incompatibility with Internet Explorer 11. On all merge requests in all projects the 'Changes' tab does not display the changes in IE11 but instead fails with 'Something went wrong on our end'. The reason ist, that this code snipped produces different results on Firefox and Internet Explorer 11:

```
var element = document.createElement('a');
element.href = '/some/absolute/url';
alert(element.pathname);
```

With Internet Explorer 11 the alert will print a relative path, whereas with Firefox the alert will print an absolute path. For GitLab this meant that a wrong AJAX URL was composed which resulted in a 404.

## Screenshots (if relevant)
None.

Stop DDOSing ourselves

## What does this MR do?

Adds `hiddenInterval` to `SmartInterval` settings. This will be the interval used whilst the tab is inactive. If this setting is not set it will `cancel` as it would have done before.

Adds `immediateExecution` to `SmartInterval` settings. This boolean will dictate whether to execute the callback once before the first interval or not.

Uses `SmartInterval` with the new `hiddenInterval` settings to slow the polling for the MR widget on inactive tabs.

Fixes issue where `SmartInterval`s `visibilitychange` listeners are not getting called because jQuery doesn't support them.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?

We're ddosing ourselves on the MR page.

Explicitly declare all javascript globals and all eslint rule violations

This merge request takes every single external global variable referenced within a javascript file and explicitly marks it with a `/* global Foo */` comment block at the top of the script.

This also expands all blanket instances of `/* eslint-disable */` with an explicit list of disabled rules.  This is useful because if we need to search for violations of a particular rule we can simply grep the codebase for something like `no-unused-vars` or `semi` and find all of the places where this rule has yet to be fixed.

Lastly, it also removes and resolves any existing `no-undef` eslint violations.  This is useful for catching mistakes like forgetting to declare a variable with `var`/`let`/`const` which can cause hard to find bugs.

## What does this MR do?

1. Looks for generic uses of `/* eslint-disable */` and refactors them into individual rule exceptions.
2. Looks for all occurrences of `/* eslint-disable ... no-undef */` and resolves them by either fixing bugs or declaring globals with `/* global Foo */`.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

This touches a lot of files, most changes touch nothing other than comment blocks or whitespace.  The exceptions are the following 14 files which required some small bug fixes after removing `no-undef`:

- api.js
- breakpoints.js
- build.js
- commits.js
- diff_notes/components/jump_to_discussion.js.es6
- gfm_auto_complete.js.es6

Introduce $CI_BUILD_REF_SLUG

## What does this MR do?

Adds `$CI_BUILD_REF_SLUG` to the variables exposed to the runner. This is based on `$CI_BUILD_REF_NAME` but lowercased, shortened to 63 bytes maximum, and with characters invalid in URLs and domain names replaced with `-`. 

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Slugs don't have a uniqueness guarantee. !7983 introduces an environment name slug which *is* unique, so I'm not as exercised about this as I was.

Should the slug be published in the API? It's available through the `variables` endpoint, but perhaps it should be part of `GET /project/:id/builds` ?

I've called it `ref_slug` rather than just `slug` as there are number of possibilities for slugification in a build (unlike an environment, where only the name makes sense to slugify).

## Why was this MR needed?

`$CI_BUILD_REF_NAME` is not suited for URLs and domain names, given the list of valid characters in a git ref.

Allow users to seed the initial runner registration token using an environment variable

## What does this MR do?
Allow users to seed the initial runner registration token using an environment variable

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

- Naming, do we want to make sure we are clear it's the 'registration' token. Like GITLAB_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN vs what I have now, GITLAB_RUNNER_TOKEN
- Not sure we've tested a seed fixture before, I just made up a directory structure for the test

At the moment I want to use this in our idea to production demo:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/22190

This is useful for when runner is bundled with gitlab, like in a kubernetes stack, and we want the runner to be able to register with gitlab as soon as they both come up.

Add a slug to environments

## What does this MR do?

Adds a `slug` field to the `environments` table, populating existing rows and ensuring that new rows will get an entry.

Cleaning examples:

* `review/foo`  => `review-foo-5gghdf`
* `review-foo` => `review-foo`
* `1-foo` => `env-1-foo-e2hx12`
* `production` => `production`
* `Production` => `production-f8ddlz`

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

This migration requires downtime. I don't see a way to avoid it.

## Why was this MR needed?

External services often have more restrictive rules on naming than those enforced for `environments.name`. In particular, forward slashes and names longer than 24 characters causes problems on OpenShift. `slug` is designed to be an acceptable alternative to `name` in these situations. Since forward slashes are a documented part of environment names, to set environment types, we need an envionmnent slug, not just a slug for the branch name.

Resolve ""Manual actions on pipeline graph""

## What does this MR do?
Improves the pipeline graph:
- add actions to each node
- always show the status icon
- improves style
- adds new icons to use only on the pipeline graph
- fixes tooltip body
- adds partial to render the graph node

### Hover state:
@dimitrieh 

This MR does not implements 100% of the mockups - https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/progress/dimitrie/pipelines-graphic/22604-spec-previews/#artboard0

As you can see in the mockups, each node has 2 separate hover states, one for the all content and one for the action icon.
In order to not hover the all content when we hover the action icon we would need to refactor the all HTML & CSS of all the pipeline graph, lines included.
The hover problem can be seen in the following video.
[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2xW80W4hUf0cnJoS1RGQ2hWZlU/view)

As you can see in the video, the build node is hovered even when the mouse seems to be far from the element.

It does not seem wise to me to change the HTML & CSS now for two reasons:
- we would need to rewrite almost everything;
- we will probably rewrite everything when we move this to vue.

Given the latter point, and considering it will be a bug effort to make the hover states equal to the mockups, I suggest we do that when we rewrite the all view.
This is fixable, though, but requires some effort & time.

I can, although, be missing something. @annabeldunstone do you see any quick/easy fix here?

Make autocomplete request performant

## What does this MR do?

Restricts the `autocomplete_sources`action to returning the `json`of one specific `at` type at a time.

Makes sure all commands start by immediately showing the `loading` dropdown.

If the `loading` dropdown is active, we will request and load in the data for that specific `at` type. We manually trigger the filter again. This time, if `loading` dropdown is not active, initiate default filter behaviour and use the correct data template.

Also fixes an issue where `setup` was called multiple times by only setting up and destroying atwho on a focused/blured input.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

## Why was this MR needed?

`autocomplete_sources` was requested on page load and is large.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

In order to get multiple alerts to appear manually while testing, I simply added the following block to [app/views/shared/_no_password.html.haml](app/views/shared/_no_password.html.haml):

```

.no-password-message.alert.alert-warning.hidden-xs
  You won't be able to pull or push project code via #{gitlab_config.protocol.upcase} until you #{link_to 'set a password', edit_profile_password_path} on your account

  .pull-right
    = link_to ""Don't show again"", profile_path(user: {hide_no_password: true}), method: :put
    |
    = link_to 'Remind later', '#', class: 'hide-no-password-message'

.no-password-message.alert.alert-warning.hidden-xs
  You won't be able to pull or push project code via #{gitlab_config.protocol.upcase} until you #{link_to 'set a password', edit_profile_password_path} on your account

  .pull-right
    = link_to ""Don't show again"", profile_path(user: {hide_no_password: true}), method: :put
    |
    = link_to 'Remind later', '#', class: 'hide-no-password-message'

.no-password-message.alert.alert-warning.hidden-xs
  You won't be able to pull or push project code via #{gitlab_config.protocol.upcase} until you #{link_to 'set a password', edit_profile_password_path} on your account

    |
    = link_to 'Remind later', '#', class: 'hide-no-password-message'
```


## Why was this MR needed?

More alert-warning stripes are coming via the CI usage limits implementation in EE (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/965), and these layout margins and colors were becoming messy.

Accept environment variables from the `pre-receive` script

## Summary

1. Starting version 2.11, git changed the way the pre-receive flow works.
  - Previously, the new potential objects would be added to the main repo. If the pre-receive passes, the new objects stay in the repo but are linked up. If the pre-receive fails, the new objects stay orphaned in the repo, and are cleaned up during the next `git gc`.
  - In 2.11, the new potential objects are added to a temporary ""alternate object directory"", that git creates for this purpose. If the pre-receive passes, the objects from the alternate object directory are migrated to the main repo. If the pre-receive fails the alternate object directory is simply deleted.
2. In our workflow, the pre-recieve script (in `gitlab-shell`) calls the
   `/allowed` endpoint, which calls out directly to git to perform
   various checks. These direct calls to git do _not_ have the necessary
   environment variables set which allow access to the ""alternate object
   directory"" (explained above). Therefore these calls to git are not able to
   access any of the new potential objects to be added during this push.

3. We fix this by accepting the relevant environment variables
   (`GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, and
   `GIT_QUARANTINE_PATH`) on the `/allowed` endpoint, and then include
   these environment variables while calling out to git.

4. This commit includes these environment variables while making the ""force
   push"" check.

Make CI badge hitboxes better match container

## What does this MR do?

Makes the Pipeline graph badge hitboxes accurately match their containers.
Currently, there's an issue where the badge highlights, as though, it's clickable, but clicking it does nothing:

![before](/uploads/668f841c640bc586044c89bed9f1e1e9/before.gif)

This is due to the `<a>` and `<button>` elements being padded into the parent elements. So, the parent would react to a cursor, but the cursor wouldn't be on the `<a>`/`<button>` yet.

![before-hitbox](/uploads/6ebaaa4be1096fbfc37f8d73da492c7b/before-hitbox.png)

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?

Maybe the tests? I kept the style changes as minimal as possible.

## Why was this MR needed?

I was annoyed every time I clicked on a badge that I was _clearly on_ (it highlighted), but nothing happened.
If I found it irritating, perhaps someone else did too.

## Screenshots (if relevant)

Allow the --limit option to control the number of jobs a single runner will run

## What does this MR do?
Implements two new features for the `run-single` executor:
 * Make the existing `--limit` option specify the maximum number of builds the runner will execute.  The default of zero means run forever.   Previously, it appeared this option did not do anything.
 * Adds a new `--wait-timeout` option that specifies how long a the runner will wait for jobs.  The default of zero means wait forever

## Why was this MR needed?
This MR introduces new functionality that is useful when you want to run the gitlab-runner on cluster resources managed by a DRM like LSF.  
In these systems, you cannot have an executable running forever.  Instead you submit jobs (executable) to run for a max-time.  
With the new functionality of this MR, you can submit a job to run the gitlab-runner in `run-single` mode with `--limit=1 --wait-timeout=600`.   If a job becomes available within 600 seconds, it will be built, and then the runner will exit, returning the machine resources back to the cluster.

## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?
- [x] Understand the `complexity` build failure.
- [x] Understand the `unit tests` build failure.
- [ ] This code has only been tested with the ""shell"" and ""docker"" executors.   Will others have unforeseen issues?

We wanted to check that the text could be encoded as JSON, because
conflict resolutions are passed back and forth in that format, so the
file itself must be UTF-8. However, all strings from the repository come
back without an encoding from Rugged, making them ASCII_8BIT.

We force to UTF-8, and reject if it's invalid. This still leaves the
problem of a file that 'looks like' UTF-8 (contains valid UTF-8 byte
sequences), but isn't. However:

1. If the conflicts contain the problem bytes, the user will see that
   the file isn't displayed correctly.
2. If the problem bytes are outside of the conflict area, then we will
   write back the same bytes when we resolve the conflicts, even though
   we though the encoding was UTF-8.

I don't know why this happens exactly, but given an upstream and fork repository
from a customer, both of which required GC, resolving conflicts would corrupt
the fork so badly that it couldn't be cloned.

This isn't a perfect fix for that case, because the MR may still need to be
merged manually, but it does ensure that the repository is at least usable.

My best guess is that when we generate the index for the conflict
resolution (which we previously did in the target project), we obtain a
reference to an OID that doesn't exist in the source, even though we already
fetch the refs from the target into the source.

Explicitly setting the source project as the place to get the merge index from
seems to prevent repository corruption in this way.

This implemetation respect the users action shortcuts,
handled in this order:

1) Two hardcoded keystrokes:

* crtl+f engage search on tree view
* esc: defocus: next keystrokes goes to desktop

2) Try to invoke user defined shortcut action

3) RETURN-key: activate action of selected column
   currently works on the name-column only

4) shortcut goes to Treeview

For the testers:

The new verbs ""stack up/down"" are not bound to keystrokes. Set them up as you like via
preferences / interface / keyboard shortcuts / selection / stack up and down

Try keystrokes with focus on desktop, on object-panel and compare with layer-panel:

PageUp/Down + - shift, ctrl

esc esc

arrow esc arrow

ctrl+f

V, H - may(!) flip objects

ctrl+a (!)

! invert selection

Beside user definable keystrokes, there are some hardcoded:

arrow-up/down + shift,ctrl

[ ] - rotate objects - not user defined actions, so does not work in panel focus

/ * also keypad / * is usually fold/unfold tree but * actually selects the ""star tool"",

Avoid conflicts when merge CE to EE by backporting code from EE.

Instead of checking in `SlashCommands::InterpretService` what the issuable the
type of the issuable is, ask the issuable if it is capable to do those thing and
implement it in the issuable itself. The issuable will check if it's possible
and if the licensed feature is available.

This should also make it easier to ever add multiple assignees to MergeRequests.

In CE only the admin has access to all private groups & projects. In EE also an
auditor can have full private access.

To overcome merge conflicts, or accidental incorrect access rights, abstract
this out in `User#full_private_access?`.

`User#admin?` now only should be used for admin-only features. For private
access-related features `User#full_private_access?` should be used.

Conflicts used to take a `Repository` and pass that to
`Gitlab::Highlight.highlight`, which would call `#gitattribute` on the
repository. Now they use a `Gitlab::Git::Repository`, which didn't have that
method defined - but defining it on `Gitlab::Git::Repository` does make it
available on `Repository` through `method_missing`, so we can do that and both
cases will work.

When we added caching, this meant that calling `can_be_resolved_in_ui?` didn't
always call `lines`, which meant that we didn't get the benefit of the
side-effect from that, where it forced the conflict data itself to UTF-8.

To fix that, make this explicit by separating the `raw_content` (any encoding)
from the `content` (which is either UTF-8, or an exception is raised).

- Move title stack code into session name controller
- More refactoring. Rename profileName to firstSessionName. Move defaultName to the name controller and rename it to originalName. Add comments. This really needs to be burned to the ground and rewritten.
- Fix bug where setting the original name reset the window title

Add support for radio buttons that aren't matrixes in prefs. Convert the prompt before closing pref to a nonmatrix so it takes less space.

GitLab EE extends Member#add_user by adding some LDAP specific flags.
Prior to these changes, the only way this could be done was by modifying
Member#add_user in place. This could lead to merge conflicts whenever a
developer wants to change this method.

To resolve this issue, the logic that EE extends has been moved into a
separate method with the appropriate arguments. This allows EE to extend
the logic by prepending the method using an EE specific module.

In a few models we define ActiveRecord enums that are redefined in EE
using the following pattern:

    enum :some_enum, {
      ...
    }.merge(EE_ENUM_VALUES)

This particular approach is problematic to deal with, because it
requires that we `prepend` and EE module _before_ defining the enum.
This typically translates to the `prepend` being the first line in the
model in EE, but this can easily lead to merge conflicts when developers
add more `include` and/or `prepend` lines.

As part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8244 and
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8241 we are moving
`prepend` to the last line in a file, reducing the chances of running
into merge conflicts. This poses a bit of a problem with the pattern
above, because this pattern does not allow us to move the `prepend`
further down a file.

To resolve this problem, we simply move the Hash value of the enum to a
separate class method. This method is defined in a separate module where
necessary, allowing us to use it like so:

    enum :failure_reasons, ::SomeModelEnums.failure_reasons

The method in turn is defined in a very straightforward manner:

    module SomeModelEnums
      def self.failure_reasons
        {
          ...
        }
      end
    end

This makes it easy for EE to add values without requiring the `prepend`
to be placed before the `enum` is defined.

In EE we redefine Environment#terminals, which makes it impossible to
use `allow_any_instance_of(Environment)` or
`expect_any_instance_of(Environment)`. Other approaches of stubbing
this class, such as by stubbing `new`, only result in spec failures.

To solve this issue, we add a simple `defined?(EE)` check in the tests
to change the thing that we are testing. This is rather obnoxious,
because it requires EE knowledge in CE, and can break if
`EE::Environment` is removed without updating CE. Unfortunately, it
appears to be the only solution we have apart from modifying these tests
in EE (which would cause merge conflicts).

This sets up GitLab CI to automatically push CE master changes into EE
master, or revert them if the changes cause merge conflicts. The CI
configuration contains a single job to do this: `merge:master`. This job
is executed for every push to master, and periodically using a CI
schedule.

The periodic job is necessary because incremental jobs may not be able
to revert commits if newly added commits depend on these commits. By
re-running the job periodically (including all changes since a large
enough time frame), we can ensure that such commits are also reverted
(if they still conflict at that time).

The job runs in its own ""merge"" stage, _after_ the build and prepare
stages, but _before_ running the tests. This ensures that randomly
failing tests won't prevent code from being merged into EE. Running the
stage after the ""prepare"" stage reduces the chances of the job reverting
CE changes just because it ran before a corresponding EE MR was merged
into EE master.

Instead of requiring one separate document for every version (which is
created by release managers), we now use a single document for both
Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. This allows developers to add
guidelines right away, instead of release managers having to determine
what to add.

Version specific upgrading instructions are placed in a separate
section. This prevents instructions from lingering around for many
versions should a developer forget to remove them. This also ensures
that all instructions are kept in a single place, instead of being
spread across different documents.

A minor downside is that CE and EE guidelines now live in the same
document, which could cause merge conflicts. Since we are working
towards a single codebase, this should only be an issue until we merge
the codebases together; something we expect to do in the coming months.

This commit also removes all old upgrading instructions, but these can
still be accessed using Git branch specific URLs (included in the
updating README).

When the GitHub importer creates a merge request, it retrieves the SHA
but does not actually create the source branch. This makes it impossible
to merge an open merge request, particularly if the source branch were
from a forked project. In that case, the branch will never exist because
the original `project-name:source-branch` name is never created, nor
is it a valid branch name.

To prevent possible branch name conflicts, forked source branches
are now renamed `github/fork/project-name/source-branch` and created
when necessary.

Note that we only create the source branch if the merge request
is open. For projects that have many merge requests, the project
would end up with a lot of possibly dead branches.

Previously the frontend assumed that the user had to be able to merge to
that project in order to resolve conflicts. However, this is overly
restrictive, as the user only has to be able to push to the source
branch. In fact, appending the text /conflicts to the merge request
would bring up the conflict resolution page.

This confusion happens when a project contains a protected branch that
only allows maintainers to push. Users with Developer access no longer
have permission to merge, but they still can create branches in that
project.

To fix this issue, we now loosen the permission check for the ""Resolve
conflicts"" button and only check for access to push to the source
branch. This is consistent with what the backend does in
MergeRequests::Conflicts::ListService#can_be_resolved_by?.

This is implemented with a general infrastructure as it is likely
other conflicting keyword sets will be added. As it stands the
implementation can only be used for sets of keywords within ""param"";
to manage conflicts between ""param"" and ""cell"" would require some kind
of communication between the setattr methods of the CastepParam and
CastepCell objects.

- The installer requires administrator privileges. This means HKMU always resolves to HKLM.
